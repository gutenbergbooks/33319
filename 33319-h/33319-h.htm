<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="dct01"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE aim of the publishers and writer, in preparing this
volume for young people, is to give a view of the
principal places in England and France where the
most interesting events have occurred; and, by a
free use of pictures and illustrative stories, to present
historic views of the two countries in an entertaining
and attractive manner.</p>

<p>An American teacher takes a class of boys on a vacation tour to
England and France, and interests them in those places that illustrate
the different periods of English and French history. It is his purpose
to give them in this manner a picturesque view of present scenes and
past events, and to leave on their minds an outline of history for careful
reading to fill.</p>

<p>A few of the stories are legendary, as the &ldquo;Jolly Harper Man&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Wise Men of Gotham;&rdquo; but these illustrate the quaint
manners and customs of the Middle Ages. Nearly all of the stories
that relate to history are strictly true.</p>

<p>The illustrations of history, both by pencil and pen, are given in
the disconnected way that a traveller would find them in his journeys;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>iv]</a></span>
but they may be easily combined by memory in their chronological
order, and made to form a harmonious series of pictures.</p>

<p>The writer has sought to amuse as well as to instruct, and for this
purpose the personal experiences of the young travellers are in part
given. Two of the boys, who have small means, make the trip in
the cheapest possible manner. Tommy Toby meets the mishaps a
thoughtless boy might experience. The other travellers have an eye
for the literary and poetic scenes and incidents of the tour.</p>


<p class="hrpad">That the volume may amuse and entertain the young reader, and
awaken in him a greater love of books of history, biography, and travel,
is the hope of the publishers and the author.</p>

<p class="signoff">28 Worcester St., Boston, Mass.</p>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE JOURNEY PROPOSED.</span></h2>


<p><span class="dct02"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE school&mdash;is&mdash;dismissed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words fell hesitatingly, and it seemed to us
regretfully, from the tutor&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>The dismission was for the spring vacation. It
was at the close of a mild March day; there was a
peculiar warmth in the blue sky and cloudless sunset;
the south winds lightly stirred the pines, and through the open window
wandered into the school-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dismissed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Usually at this word, on the last day of the term, every boy leaped
to his feet: there would be a brief bustle, then Master Lewis would
be seen seated alone amid the silence of the school-room.</p>

<p>But to-day there was something in the tone of the master&rsquo;s
voice that checked the usual unseemly haste. Every boy remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
in his seat, as though waiting for Master Lewis to say something
more.</p>

<p>The master saw it, and choked with feeling. It was a little thing,
the seeming unwillingness to part; but it indicated to both teacher
and school an increasing respect and affection.</p>

<p>Master Lewis had learned to love his pupils: his hesitating words
told <em>them</em> that. Every boy in his school loved Master Lewis: their
conduct in remaining in their seats told <em>him</em> that.</p>

<p>The master stepped from his desk, as was his custom when about
to say any thing unusually social and confidential.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish to tell you frankly, and you deserve to
know it, that I have become so attached to you during the winter
term that I am sorry to part from you, even for a week&rsquo;s vacation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we might pass the vacation together,&rdquo; said Frank Gray,&mdash;meaning
by &ldquo;we&rdquo; the teacher and the school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once read of a French teacher,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, &ldquo;who used
to travel with his scholars in the neighboring countries, during vacations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be just grand if we could travel with Master Lewis
during our summer vacation!&rdquo; said Tom Toby, who, although the
dullest scholar in the school, always became unexpectedly bright over
any plan that promised an easy time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might visit some country in Europe,&rdquo; said Ernest. &ldquo;We
should then be learning geography and history, and so our education
would go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would help us also in the study of modern languages,&rdquo; said
Frank Gray.</p>

<p>Tom Toby&rsquo;s sudden brightness of face seemed to be eclipsed by
these last remarks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we had better travel in places nearer home, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was seasick once: it was <em>orful</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
&ldquo;The sickness is a short and healthy one,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find it a healthy one, if you ever are rolling on the
Atlantic, with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Twice a thousand miles behind you, and a thousand miles before.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be sick in that way again for any thing. I tell you &rsquo;twas
<em>orful</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Lewis laughed at Tom&rsquo;s pointed objection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to learning the languages,&rdquo; continued Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed all
the Frenchmen and Germans I have tried to talk with speak their own
language very poorly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s percentages in the modern languages were the lowest of his
class, and Master Lewis could not restrain a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once tried to make a Frenchman understand that I thought
Napoleon Bonaparte was the greatest man that ever lived. He kept
saying, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cela va sans dire, cela va sans dire!</i> [That is a matter of course.]
I never knew what he meant, to say: all I could make of it was, <em>That
goes without saying any thing</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French teacher of whom I spoke,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, &ldquo;used
to allow his pupils to travel much on foot, and to visit such places as
their love of history, geography, and natural science, made them most
wish to see. So they journeyed in a zigzag way, and published a book
called &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyages en zigzag</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not object to learning history, geography, and natural
science in that way,&rdquo; said Tom Toby. &ldquo;I should rather walk after
history than study it the way I do now. I should prefer <em>riding</em> after it
to walking, however. I wouldn&rsquo;t be cheated out of having a real good
time during my summer vacation for any thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shadow fell on Master Lewis&rsquo;s face, as though his feelings were
hurt by something implied in Tom&rsquo;s remarks. Tom saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but I should have a real good time if I were with you, Master
Lewis, even if it were on the Atlantic, or studying French in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have often thought I would like to travel with my boys abroad.
I could take my first class, if I could secure their parents&rsquo; consent, the
coming summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every boy joined in the exclamation. Tom&rsquo;s voice, however, was a
little behind the others,&mdash;&ldquo;-o-d.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me suggest to the class,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;that each
member speak to his parents about this matter during the present
vacation; and let each boy who can go send me in a letter during the
week a map of the country and the places he would most like to visit.
He can draw it in ink or pencil, and he need only put down upon it
the places he would most like to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exclamation was unanimous.</p>

<p>The boys left their seats.</p>

<p>Tom Toby&rsquo;s face had become very animated again. Presently the
boys of the class were all gathered about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It is just grand. Let us form a secret
society, and call ourselves the Zigzagers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; unanimously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why a secret society?&rdquo; asked Frank Gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something so mysterious about a secret society,&rdquo; said Tom.
&ldquo;Gives one such a good opinion of himself. Have a constitution, and
by-laws, and wear a pin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first class in Master Lewis&rsquo;s school parted in high spirits, their
faces bright with smiles as they went out into the light of the March
sunset.</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s last words on parting were: &ldquo;Try to think up a secret for the
society: it should be something surprising.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first class in Master Lewis&rsquo;s school numbered six boys:&mdash;</p>

<p class="leftind"><span class="smcap">Frank Gray</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Ernest Wynn</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Wyllys Wynn</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Toby</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">George Howe</span>, and<br />
<span class="smcap">Leander Towle</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
Frank Gray was the oldest boy and finest scholar in the school.
He was about fifteen years of age; was tall and manly, and was more
intimate with Master Lewis than with any of his schoolmates. Thomas
Toby, who disliked Frank&rsquo;s precise manners and rather unsocial ways,
used to call him &ldquo;Lord <em>I</em>.&rdquo; Frank, however, was not intentionally
reserved: he was merely studious in his leisure, and best liked the society
of those from whom he could learn the most.</p>

<p>Ernest and Wyllys Wynn were brothers. Ernest had made himself
popular at school by his generous, affectionate disposition, and his ready
sympathy for any one in distress. He lived, as it were, a life outside
of himself; and his interest in the best good of others made for himself
unconsciously a pure and lovable character. He was fond of music,
and an agreeable singer: he liked the old English and Scottish ballads,
and so sung the songs of true feeling that every one is eager to hear.</p>

<p>He often went to an almshouse near Master Lewis&rsquo;s to sing to the
old people there. The paupers all loved him, and clustered eagerly
around him when he appeared. His songs recalled their childhood
scenes in other lands. On fine summer evenings he might often be seen
on the lawn before the charitable institution, with a crowd of poor people
around him, whom he delighted with &ldquo;Robin Ruff and Gaffer Green,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Mistletoe Bough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Highland Mary,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vale of Avoca,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Robin Adair,&rdquo; or something aptly selected to awaken tender feelings
and associations.</p>

<p>Nearly all the children of the town seemed to know him, and regard
him as a friend, and used often to run out to meet him when he
appeared in the street. Master Lewis, in speaking of Ernest, once
quoted Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;The true mark of a good heart
is its capacity for loving.&rdquo; It was meant to be a picture, and it was a
true one.</p>

<p>Wyllys Wynn was much like his brother, and a very close friendship
existed between them. He was fond of history and poetry; he wrote
finely, and usually took the first prize for composition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
Tom Toby was quite a different character. He was just a <em>boy</em>, in
the common sense of the word. In whatever he attempted to do, he
was sure to blunder, and was as sure to turn the blunder to some
comical account. He had a way of making fun of himself, and of
inciting others to laugh at his own expense, which Master Lewis was
disposed to censure as wanting in proper self-respect.</p>

<p>Tom had no particular friend. He seemed to like all boys alike,
except those whom he thought insincere and affected, and such were
the butt of his sharp wit and ready ridicule.</p>

<p>Tom was famous among the boys for telling stories, and these often
related to his own mishaps. A knot of boys was often seen gathered
around him to listen to his random talk, his wit, and his day dreams.
Though a poor scholar, he was an apt talker, and almost any subject
would furnish him a text.</p>

<p>His father was a Maine lumber-dealer, and he had spent much time
with his father in the logging camps and backwoods towns of the
Pine Tree State. His adventures in these regions, told in his droll
way, often excited the wonder of his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a bear in the backwoods?&rdquo; one of the boys
asked him one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw a live one but once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do? I received a polite bow from him, and then I remembered
that I was wanted at home, and went home immediately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was this way.&rdquo;&mdash;All of the boys of the class now gathered
around Tommy, as was the custom when he seemed about to tell one
of his odd stories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I attempted one day to rob a pigeon-woodpecker&rsquo;s nest which
I had found in one of the old logging roads that had not been
used for several years. The nest was in a big hollow tree. The top
of the tree had blown off, leaving a trunk some twelve or fifteen feet
high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/zje006.jpg" width="222" height="600"
alt="Tommy and the bear" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;These woodpeckers make a hole for
their nest so large that you can run the
whole length of your arm into it. I had
long wanted a few eggs from one of these
birds&rsquo; nests. I had heard the lumber-men
tell how white and handsome the eggs
are.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was climbing up the tree very fast,
my heart beating like a trip-hammer, when
I heard a scratching sound inside the big
trunk, and then a shaking at the top. I
thought it very mysterious. I stopped,
and looked up. I saw something black,
like a fur cap. I opened my eyes and
mouth so as to take a big look, and just
then <em>out popped a bear&rsquo;s head</em> from the top
of the trunk, and looked over very inquiringly.
I just looked once. He seemed to
recognize me. He bowed. Then I remembered
that father had said I must come
home early. I dropped to the ground, and
I never picked up my feet so lively before
in my life. I <em>flew</em>. When I got safely
out of the woods, I thought of the
woodpecker. I never felt so glad for
any bird in my life. What a narrow
escape that bird had! <em>I had been there
myself</em>, and knew. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
robbed her nest for any thing after
that.</p>

</div>

<p>When Tommy first came to the boarding-school, he greatly amused
his companions one day by attempting to ride on the hose of a street-sprinkler&rsquo;s
cart, when it was not in action. He had never seen such a
carriage, and thought it offered a wonderfully convenient arrangement
for riding behind. Presently the driver raised the lever, and the
amazed lad found himself caught in the shower, and tumbled into
the dirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me the thing was bewitched?&rdquo; said he, as the
boys gathered around him.</p>

<p>But his indignation immediately subsided, and rubbing off the water
and dirt, and discovering the use of the cart, he was soon found laughing
as heartily as the others, and quite outdid them in relating to Master
Lewis the odd adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
George Howe and Leander Towle were cousins and very intimate
friends. They were unlike Frank Gray and the Wynns. They cared
little for poetry, art, or music. They stood well in their classes in
mathematics and the exact sciences, were fond of boating and out-of-door
sports, and both were warm friends of Tom Toby.</p>

<p>The pleasant relations that existed between the teacher and the
school also prevailed to a great degree among the lads themselves.
Frank Gray and Tommy Toby, being quite unlike, sometimes had a
tilt in words; but, as Frank was a gentleman by nature and training, and
as Tommy had tender feelings, their differences were easily harmonized.
The mild manners and good sense of Master Lewis seemed to impress
themselves strongly on the characters of his pupils. Tommy Toby,
who was often thoughtless in his conduct, was almost the only exception
to the rule.</p>

George and Leander.&mdash;What may be seen for $100.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dcf01"><span class="dropcap">F</span></span>ROM Frank Gray, Master Lewis received the following
letter early in vacation-week:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Cambridge, Mass.</span>, March 20.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Friend and Teacher</span>:</p>

<p>My good father has consented for me to go.</p>

<p>He thinks that the tour, to be a really profitable one, should
be short, and that it would be better to attempt to visit only
a portion of a single country.</p>

<p>I have decided what country I would most like to visit.
It is &ldquo;fair Normandy,&rdquo; the scene of the most romantic events of both English
and French history.</p>

<p>I would go from Boston to London; from London to Dieppe; and then I
would make partly on foot a zigzag journey to the places indicated on the
enclosed map of Normandy, and such others, including Paris, as you may suggest.</p>

<p>The old towns on the coast of Normandy are especially beautiful in summer,
with their cool harbors, fine landscapes, and historic ruins. I am told that they
are favorite places of resort of both the English and French people, and that
they give one delightful insights of the best social life.</p>

<p>In this journey, we would have views of London and Paris, and would be able
to study that part of France whose history is associated with old English wars,
and that is most famous in romance and song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
I make the suggestion at your own
request. You are the better judge in
the whole matter, and it will give my
father pleasure to adopt any plan for me
you may think advisable.</p>

<p>I thank you again for the invitation,
and father wishes me to express to you
his sense of your kindness.</p>

<p>I wish you a most pleasant vacation,
and am</p>

<p class="sig">Affectionately yours,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Frank Gray.</span></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Fan me with a feather!&rdquo; Tom
Toby used sometimes to say after
reading one of Frank&rsquo;s letters; and
we are not sure but this careful note
would have tempted a light remark,
had he ever seen it.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">NORMAN FISHER-GIRL.</p>

<p>Soon after Frank&rsquo;s note, came a
note from the Wynns:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Concord, Mass.</span>, March 22.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Teacher</span>:</p>

<p>Father thinks so favorably of your kind invitation that we venture to express
our preference for a route of travel.</p>

<p>It is a very simple one. We would go from Boston to Liverpool, and walk
from Liverpool to London, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en zigzag</i>.</p>

<p>This would take us through the heart of England, and enable us to visit such
historic places as Boscobel, where Charles II. was concealed after the battle of
Worcester, old Nottingham, Kenilworth, Oxford, and Godstowe Nunnery,
Stratford-on-Avon, White Horse Hill, and a great number of old English
villages and ruins.</p>

<p>Or we would go to Glasgow, thence to Edinburgh, and then make short
journeys towards London, visiting Abbotsford, Melrose, and the ruins on the
Border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
We are reading Walter Scott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Kenilworth.&rdquo; The book, as you
may have guessed, has caused us to
set our affections strongly on the
middle of England as the scene of
our proposed tour.</p>

<p class="sig">With kind remembrances of all
your kindness to us.<br />

<p>Later came a characteristic
note from two of the other boys.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Teacher</span>,&mdash;Our parents
are desirous for us to go, but can
hardly afford the expense. We have
permission to accept your invitation,
if we will travel so cheaply
that the cost to each will not be
more than $100. Can this be
done? We are willing to go and return in the steerage, travel third-class, and
take shilling lodgings, and eat plain food. We would prefer a tour through the
great manufacturing towns of Scotland and England.</p>

<p class="sig">Respectfully,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">George Howe.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Leander Towle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On Saturday of vacation-week, Master Lewis opened a much-blotted
envelope, and read the following rather surprising communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Master Lewis</span>,&mdash;Father&rsquo;s answer to me is, &ldquo;You may go anywhere that
promises any improvement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have been thinking of it. One should see their own country first. This
journey would about suit me: they are very interesting places,&mdash;Newport, Old
Orchard Beach, White Mountains, Franconia Mountains, Adirondacks, Saratoga,
Niagara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
Mother has been crying. She is afraid, if I go to Europe, I will never come
back again.</p>

<p>Father thinks that there is no danger of that.</p>

<p>If I must go across the sea, I would prefer to go&mdash;anywhere <em>you</em> like, only
take the shortest route and fastest steamer over the water.</p>

<p>Were you ever sick on the ocean?</p>

<p>I am going to organize a society of travellers in the school,&mdash;a secret society
that will pledge each other never-ending friendship and assistance.</p>

<p>I may need assistance myself in my life. Father thinks I shall.</p>

<p>I am trying to think of a secret for the society. I can think of hardly any
thing that the rest of the world do not know.</p>

<p class="sig">Hope you are well.<br />

The spring and summer
term&mdash;the session
lasted through April,
May, and June&mdash;opened
under unusually promising
circumstances. The
prospect of the journey
of the first class seemed
to stimulate the whole
school: in fact, little else
was talked of out of
school-hours.</p>

<p>Master Lewis&rsquo;s customary
address at the
close of the first day of
the term was waited with
impatient interest. When
the time came for it, there
was almost a painful silence
in the school-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 310px;">

<img src="images/zje011.jpg" width="310" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">STREET SCENE IN NORMANDY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall speak first,&rdquo;
said Master Lewis, &ldquo;on
the subject about which
your conduct tells me
you are most eager to
hear. I have decided to
make the journey abroad with the first class <em>this</em> year&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was suppressed applause by the class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Next</em> year I hope to visit Switzerland and Italy, with all the members
of the school who can go, if this proposed journey should prove a
success. I say this, so that the second and third classes may feel that
they, too, have an interest in this general plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
There was a burst of applause by the whole school.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 528px;">

<img src="images/zje012.jpg" width="528" height="450" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">COLONNADE OF THE LOUVRE.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank the boys of the first class for their letters and suggestions
about the route to be decided upon. I think I have a plan that will
be acceptable to you all. We will go first to Glasgow, will journey <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
zigzag</i> to London; will there take the steamer for Antwerp, and will
make a zigzag tour from Ghent to St. Malo, taking a glance at Belgium,
a view of the whole of Normandy and the picturesque part of Brittany,
including a visit to Paris and a view of its beautiful palaces and
parks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
&ldquo;As a preparation for this tour, I shall require the class to give
special attention to the French language and to English and French
history during the term.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every thing that Master Lewis said or did was popular with the
boys, but no decision ever received more emphatic applause.</p>

<p>Tom Toby was busy at once, forming his secret society. He
called a meeting of the boys on the evening of the very first schoolday,
in his room. The Wynns entered willingly into his plan, and
George Howe and Leander Towle warmly supported it. Frank Gray,
however, treated the matter rather indifferently, a circumstance that
Tommy quickly observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first question to be decided,&rdquo; said Tommy, when the boys had
met in his room, &ldquo;is, Shall we organize a secret society?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wynns asked Frank Gray his opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer to hold my opinion in reserve, until I understand
what the object of the society is to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to have a grip just like <em>that</em>,&rdquo; said Tommy, seizing Frank by
the hand, &ldquo;one that takes the conceit all out of you, and makes you
remember who are your friends for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I do not think I shall care to join,&rdquo; said Frank, rubbing his
crushed hand on his knee. &ldquo;I shall probably remember you as long as
I shall care to, without making any such arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think a school society is a good thing,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, mildly.
&ldquo;It promotes lasting friendships&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wanted to say.
&lsquo;It promotes lasting friendship,&rsquo; and, like a salve, it takes the conceit&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It stimulates one to do his best, and&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it exactly,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I hope you all hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s quit joking,&rdquo; said George Howe, in a matter-of-fact way.
&ldquo;A society for the purpose of reading and studying about the places we
are to visit and for correspondence with each other, when a part of us
are abroad, would be an excellent thing. I hope we may have such a
society, and shall make our very best boy President of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who may that be?&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Tommy, teasingly. &ldquo;I thought you knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is decided to call the society the Zigzag Travellers,&rdquo;
said George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A promising name,&rdquo; said Frank, who was decidedly out of humor.
&ldquo;I would suggest the Zigzag Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would nominate for President Wyllys Wynn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree to the nomination,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby: &ldquo;at last, Frank and I are
agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will prepare the rules for the society?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;George Howe,&rdquo; said Ernest.</p>

<p>To this all the boys agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shall decide upon a secret?&rdquo; asked Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would nominate Tommy Toby,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>Tom was unanimously elected.</p>

<p>The next evening a second meeting of the society was held, to
which all the boys in the school were invited. It was decided to call the
society &ldquo;The Zigzag Club.&rdquo; Charles Wyman, one of the second-class
boys, was appointed its Secretary, and general rules were adopted for the
conduct of its meetings. All of the boys, sixteen in number, became
members.</p>

<p>It was decided that the first formal meeting of the club for literary
exercises should be held in a fortnight, and that on that occasion each
boy of the first class should relate some historic story associated with
one of the places he expected to visit, and it was suggested that the
stories of the first meeting be confined to <em>Normandy</em>. Wyllys Wynn
was asked to sing some French or Norman song on the occasion, and
the Secretary was instructed to invite Master Lewis to be present, and
to deliver an address.</p>

<p>Tommy Toby had been very reserved since the first meeting of the
club. He had been quite ignored, and his feelings were hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
&ldquo;Are you sure you treated Tommy quite right at the first meeting?&rdquo;
asked Ernest Wynn of Frank Gray, quietly, as he observed Tom&rsquo;s
injured look at the second meeting of the club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I was not quite gentlemanly,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;But I had no
wish to join a society gotten up merely for fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s suggestion was the beginning of the club,&rdquo; said Ernest.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will offer the resolution,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us close this meeting,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;by recognizing the debt
we owe to one of our members. Thomas Toby is the real founder of
this club. I did not feel much interested in it at first. I do now. Let
us give Thomas a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every boy applauded the motion, which was passed enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Tommy&rsquo;s face brightened, and his eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how could you? Ernest Wynn was at the
bottom of this, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ernest <em>is</em> a better fellow than I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We both are all right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you decided upon a secret?&rdquo; continued Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought much about it,&rdquo; answered Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the result?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy turned to the blackboard, and wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">All O!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked at the characters mysteriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the secret?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I myself am going to keep it for the club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Lewis had a private talk with George Howe and Leander
Towle immediately on their return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish you to go,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I think a most profitable tour can
be made in the way you propose for $100. You can at least visit
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Birmingham, London, and Paris, and spend three
days each in the three great capital cities. The information you would
thus gain would be of great value to you. I thus estimate the probable
expense to each:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Expenses for the trip">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Steerage passage to go and return</td>
    <td class="tdr">$50.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Glasgow to Edinburgh, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, or</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">Edinburgh to London, and London to Paris by way of Dieppe, about &pound;3, or</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdl">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="tdr bt">$90.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best to make your expenses as light as possible.
I am told that one can live comfortably on four shillings a day in
Scotland and England, and for five francs a day in Paris. You will
not be able to enjoy our walks in historic places outside of the great
cities, and you will probably be obliged to return before the rest of the
party; but the very restraint you will have to use will be a good
experience for you. As Franklin once said, &lsquo;A good kick out of doors
is worth all the rich uncles in the world.&rsquo; It is good for one to bear
the yoke in his youth. You see what I mean,&mdash;self-reliance, independence!
I am not altogether sorry that you will be compelled to
make the journey in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys thanked their teacher.</p>

<p>When they had left him, George Howe said decidedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never respected any teacher as much as I do Master Lewis.
How nobly he has treated us!&rdquo;</p>

the fine Public Library of which that city

the whole character of their reading

histories of the kings and queens, and a book of marvellous old English
ballads.</p>

The Club met as appointed. Each of the six boys had made his
best preparation for the exercises of the evening. All the boys were
present; and Master Lewis and his little daughter Florence sat beside
young President Wynn, on the platform.</p>

<p>Wyllys Wynn was the first speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although President of the Club,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am expected to take
part in these exercises, and have been asked to present my story first.
Normandy is our subject to-night, and there is no name that is so
famously associated with the old Norman cities we expect to visit&mdash;Caen,
Falaise, Rouen, F&eacute;camp, St. Valery&mdash;as that of William the
Conqueror. I will tell you the story of his life, and call it</p>


<h3>THE NEW FOREST.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;About eight hundred years ago, William, Duke of Normandy,
aspired to become King of England, and to wear the crown whose
rightful claimant was Edgar Atheling. He made Harold, another heir
to the English crown, support his claim, and take an oath to be true
to him. To make Harold feel how solemn was an oath, he obliged
him to swear it over a chest full of dead men&rsquo;s bones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Harold disregarded the oath that he had taken over the chest
of bones in Normandy; and, when old Edward, who was called The
Confessor, died, he seized the crown and royal treasure for himself,
being counselled to do so by an assembly of nobles called the Witenagemote.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duke William was an ambitious and a fiery-minded man. He
gathered an army of sixty thousand men, and a fleet of a thousand
vessels and transports; and one September day he sailed from St. Valery
with his army and fleet, the trumpets sounding and a thousand banners
rising to the wind. His own ship had many-colored sails: from its
mast floated the banner of the three Norman Lions; and a golden boy,
pointing to England, glittered on the prow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
&ldquo;This fleet came into the harbor of Pevensey. He led his army to
Hastings; and there, on a bright afternoon in October, he met the army
of Harold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duke William reviewed his army, and caused his men to pray for
victory ere they laid down beneath the moon and stars to rest. In the
morning, they sung an ode, called the War Song of Roland: then a
battle was fought, and the three Norman Lions at night waved triumphantly
over the field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harold was slain, and
the monks wandered over
the battle-ground to find
his body. It was discovered
at last, a despoiled
and discrowned figure, by
Edith Swansneck, a beautiful
girl who loved Harold
and whom the dead
king had loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then William returned
to Normandy. F&eacute;camp
blazed in his honor,
and all the cities received
him with loud acclaim.</p>

<p class="caption">FINDING THE BODY OF HAROLD.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hard king was
Duke William. With his
great army of Normans,
he marched over England,
suppressing all who opposed him. The rivers were tinged with blood,
the beautiful English towns were reduced to ash-heaps, the land was
blackened with fire: he is said to have killed or maimed a hundred
thousand people.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
attention to field-sports and to hunting. He had sixty-eight royal
forests, full of stags and deer; but he permitted no one but himself and
the people of his court to hunt in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Winchester, he thought it would be a fine thing to have a great
hunting-park near his residence. There was a tract of country in the
county of Hampshire, very picturesque and beautiful, that he determined
to use for this purpose. But there were churches scattered among the
hills; and thousands of peasants dwelt here, who had rude but happy
homes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William cared little for the churches and less for the homes of the
peasants; so he sent soldiers to burn the former, and to drive the people
away from the latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing was done by the ruthless king to supply the wants of the
people, or to relieve their misery. They left their native hills with
wailing and weeping and wringing of hands, uttering imprecations on
the head of the Conqueror and upon his race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stags multiplied, and the deer increased; and delightful to
the Norman was the New Forest, on the golden autumn days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, one of the king&rsquo;s sons, a fair-haired youth, named Richard,
went to hunt in this New Forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He encountered a stag. The animal, maddened by the attack,
rushed upon the prince, and killed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the dead body was borne from the forest, broken and stained
with blood, the people said that this was a beginning of the reckoning
God would make with William, and that the New Forest would prove
an unquiet place to the Conqueror and to those of his blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish and superstitious stories began to be circulated. The
people said that the New Forest was haunted; that spirits were seen,
by moonlight, gliding among the dusky trees; that demons revelled
there when the tempest arose, and the lightnings flashed, and the rain
dashed on the great oaks. The old foresters did not wish to return to
it now. They talked of it in low whispers, as of a place accursed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
&ldquo;At last William died. It was a bitter death. The Conqueror
trembled before that <span class="smcap">Conqueror</span> to whom the princes of the earth must
yield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that, when he had reached the height of his fame, he
declared that he would surrender his crowns and kingdom to know again
&lsquo;peace of mind, the love of a true friend, or the innocent sleep of a
child.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When his last hour drew near, the nobles fled from his bedside.
His servants pillaged the apartment where he died, and rolled the dead
body from the bed, and left it lying on the floor. A good knight took
it up, and carried it to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Church, at Caen.</p>

&ldquo;He left three sons, William Rufus, Robert, and Henry. To the first
he bequeathed England, to the second Normandy, and to the last
&pound;5,000.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William Rufus now became king of England. He was called the
Red King, because he had a red face and red hair; and a red king he
proved to be, in another sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Red King, like his father, quarrelled with everybody, and, like
him, sought and found enjoyment by hunting in the New Forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One pleasant day in May, when the leaves were tender, and the
ferny hills were sunny and sprinkled with flowers, another Richard, the
son of Robert of Normandy, went to hunt in the New Forest. After a
merry time, he was accidentally shot by an arrow. Again a mournful
retinue came out of the forest, bearing the body of a prince, stained
with blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;August came, with its young deer and newly fledged birds. The
Red King, with his brother Henry and a great court-party, went to the
New Forest, to spend some days in hunting and feasting. The first
day sped merrily, and was followed by a banquet. It was held at a
place called Malwood-Keep, a famous lodge for royal hunting-parties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next night, a man with a coal-cart was riding in the New
Forest, when he discovered a body lying by the way, pierced by an arrow
in the breast. He laid it in his dirty cart, and jogged on. It was the
Red King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many stories are told of the manner in which the king was killed.
Some say that he was accidentally shot by Sir Walter Tyrrel, a famous
hunter in those days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that the king and Sir Walter came upon a stag. The
king drew his bow, and the string broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shoot, Walter!&rsquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The arrow flew, struck a tree, glanced, and buried itself in the king&rsquo;s
breast. He died where the poor peasants had foretold he would die, in
the New Forest.</p>

&ldquo;We hope to visit Caen, and its cathedral, an edifice that was founded
by the Conqueror, and that has grown for nearly a thousand years.
The Conqueror&rsquo;s tomb is before the altar, but his bones were scattered
by the Huguenots in 1562.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">Wyllys Wynn&rsquo;s story was applauded; and Master Lewis, amid the
applause, said audibly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank Gray followed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our President has told you the history of William the Conqueror
and of one of his sons, in his story of the New Forest. I will try to tell
you</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF ROBERT OF NORMANDY.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Robert of Normandy was the second son of the Conqueror, and
succeeded his father in the dukedom. He was unlike the rest of the
Conqueror&rsquo;s sons,&mdash;an easy, generous, pleasure-loving fellow; honest
in heart, and believing with wonderful simplicity that the world was all
sunshine, and that all the people in it were much like himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say, however, that he once rebelled against his father,
whom he asked to give him the old Norman kingdom. &lsquo;I am not apt
to undress before I go to bed,&rsquo; said the Conqueror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He began to rule independently, and William besieged him in the
old fortress of Gerberoi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the midst of the battle, Robert unseated a tall knight, and was
about to despatch him, when he found him to be his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was greatly touched at the discovery, and kneeling down said,
&lsquo;I pray you forgive me.&rsquo; He then raised his father, and they were
reconciled.</p>

<p class="caption">WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR REVIEWING HIS ARMY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a castle in Normandy, which we hope to visit,&mdash;a mountain
of towers rising out of the sea. Pagan priests possessed it, holy hermits
succeeded them, and the Norman Dukes regarded it as their stronghold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"><!-- original location of 'William the Conqueror reviewing his army' --></a></span>

I have brought with me a picture of it, that you may see. It is a fortress
built upon a rock; and, when the great tide sweeps in, it stands in the
sea, lofty and doubly guarded.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 529px;">

<img src="images/zje019.jpg" width="529" height="450"

</div>

<p>&ldquo;The Red King and Robert once were engaged in a war with their
brother Henry, who shut himself up in this fortress. At last, the water
in the fortress failed. The Red King was happy, but Robert began to
pity his famishing brother. So he sent him some bottles of wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A fine way to wage war,&rsquo; said the Red King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What,&rsquo; said Robert, &lsquo;shall we let our brother die of thirst? Where
shall we get another, when he is gone?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
&ldquo;We will see how Henry returned this love and brotherly kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was considered very pious, in those rude times, for a person to
make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in order to visit the Holy Sepulchre.
The Turks, who held the Holy City, abused the Christian pilgrims.
An eloquent and a fiery-minded monk, called Peter the Hermit, believing
it to be the duty of the Christian princes to wrest the Holy Sepulchre
from the power of the Turks, began to urge his opinions throughout
Europe. An intense excitement was created.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among his most fervent disciples was Robert of Normandy. In
his enthusiasm, the thoughtless, generous-hearted fellow sold his
dominions for a certain period to the Red King, and with the money
equipped a splendid retinue of knights and soldiers for service in the
Holy Land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went to Jerusalem at the head of this glittering train, and, in
union with other Christian princes and nobles, besieged the Holy City,
subdued its defenders, and obtained possession of the Saviour&rsquo;s tomb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert was one of the most conspicuous leaders in the first
crusade; and, of all the princes who aided in the recovery of the Holy
Sepulchre, he sacrificed the most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When he returned from the East, he stopped in Italy. He was
fond of minstrelsy, and of works of art; and he feasted his eyes on
the fading grandeur of the old Italian cities. As he was the rightful
claimant to the throne of England, after the death of the Red King,
and as his exploits in the Holy Land had added to his fame, the Italians
greatly admired him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While stopping in Italy among the minstrels, the pictures, and the
loveliness of that dreamy and enchanted land, he fell in love with a lady
of marvellous beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name was Sibylla. He married her, and in a little time
returned to Normandy, to find that his younger brother, Henry, had
assumed the throne of England, and was governing with a high hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that the Red King had died while Robert was tarrying in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
Italy, enamoured of Sibylla; and Henry, without waiting to see him
buried, had seized the royal treasure and the diadem, telling the nobles
that Robert had become King of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having established his government, he was prepared to give
Robert a hot reception, if he should make any trouble about the matter
on his return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert, of course, asserted his claim to the throne. Some of the
nobles sustained Henry in his usurpation, others were for Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry, however, by dint of much fawning and lying, persuaded
Robert to relinquish his claim to England, and to be content with the
little duchy of Normandy, and with a pension, which he promised to
pay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the good-natured Robert governed in Normandy, and a good-natured
government he had. He was so weak and good-natured that
he used to allow his servants to steal his clothes, while he was lying in
bed in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry, like the Red King before him, thought that Robert&rsquo;s
government was rather loose, and that it would be a very benevolent
thing to relieve the Normans of his misrule. For this reason, he went
over to Normandy with an army, took possession of the country, and
established his own hard rule, thus stealing from his brother the fair-skied
duchy that the Conqueror had given him. Having accomplished
this, he settled it that Robert was a very troublesome fellow, and that
the proper place for him was a prison; and he accordingly put him in
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not satisfied even then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day there appeared in the apartments of the castle where
Robert was confined some stone-hearted men, by order from the king.
They heated a piece of metal red-hot, and then deliberately burned out
poor Robert&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, loving eyes they were; and what sights they had seen,&mdash;the
minarets of the East glimmering in the hot sun and shady moon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
the cool palm-groves along the Jordan, the splendid streets of Antioch,
the City of the Great King, the Holy Sepulchre with its golden lamps,
Italy with its deep skies and empurpled hills! Twenty-eight years was
poor Robert imprisoned, and then he died.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">Frank&rsquo;s contribution was well received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to add something to the touching narrative we have
just heard,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;I would like to tell you about the
great sorrow that came to King Henry, after he had so wronged his
brother. Allow me to relate to you</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF THE WHITE SHIP.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Henry had a son&mdash;Prince Henry&mdash;whom he intensely loved.
The prince was wild and dissipated, and as much a despot at heart as
his father. He once boasted that, when he became king, he would yoke
the English to the plough, like oxen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king&rsquo;s plottings, and much of his cruel treatment of his brother
Robert, sprang from his strong desire that this son might succeed him
on the throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Prince Henry succeed his father as king?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people of Normandy and other French territories under the
Norman crown rebelled against Henry. The king, by the aid of the
Pope, pacified the discontented people by fair promises, and a peace
was made, upon which the king and the prince and a great retinue of
nobles went to Normandy, to arrange some very important matters of
state.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During this state visit, the Norman nobles were induced to recognize,
with great pomp, Prince Henry as the successor to the king;
and a marriage was contracted for the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In honor of these events, there were gala-days and festivals, and at
every scene of rejoicing the prince was the glittering star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
&ldquo;The heart of the king swelled with pride. He had reason to hope
that all his plottings, and pilferings of crowns and dominions, were
about to end happily. The future seemed almost without a cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One bright day in autumn, after these events, the prince and a gay
party prepared to embark for England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There came to the king a man by the name of Fitz-Stephen, who
said that he was the son of the sea-captain who conveyed the Conqueror
to England on the ship with many-colored sails. He said, also, that
he had a beautiful ship, all white, and manned by fifty sea-browned
sailors, and that he would deem it a great honor to take the royal party
to England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have ordered my ship,&rsquo; said the king, after a little deliberation;
&lsquo;but yours shall have the honor of conveying the prince and young
nobles to England.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the prince, and one hundred and twenty-two nobles, and eighteen
ladies of rank, all young, and full of merry life, went on board of the
White Ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king sailed away while it was yet day, leaving the prince and
his company still in the harbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the prince, &lsquo;the king has gone, we will have a merry-making.
The time is ours, and we can spend it right jovially on the
deck of our beautiful ship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He then ordered Fitz-Stephen to provide three casks of wine for
the fifty sailors. The harbor grew dusky, and the hunter&rsquo;s moon rose,
shimmering the wide waters. The wine flowed freely, the nobles
danced, and the beautiful ladies joined heartily in the revelries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great sea sobbed before and around them, but merry music
filled their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length, they shot out of the moonlit harbor. The sailors were
excited and half-drunk. The royal party urged them to row with
speed, in order to overtake the vessels of the king. Fitz-Stephen
was in the same condition as his crew, and steered recklessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
&ldquo;Soon there came a terrific crash. The White Ship reeled and
reeled, but went no farther. She had struck upon rocks, and the
mirth was turned to wailing and woe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the ship was sinking, the prince leaped on board a boat. As he
was rowed away, he heard his sister calling for help from the deck of
the staggering vessel. Putting back, he reached the place just as the
White Ship was making her last plunge. Great numbers of the
terrified and desperate young men leaped on board of the boat. It
overturned, and the prince went down in the deep waters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus in a moment were baffled the purposes of King Henry for so
many guilty years; and, of the three hundred souls that made merry in
the moonlit harbor of Balfleur, but one survived to tell the dismal tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some days no one dared to approach the king with the dreadful
intelligence. At length, a little boy was sent to him to break the
news, who, weeping, knelt at his feet, and told him that the White Ship
was lost, and the prince had perished. The king fell to the floor as
dead. The historians tell us that he never smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not greatly pity him; for he lied again, and he stole again,
and he made the people suffer again, and I have little doubt that he
smiled again, when some plot of his crafty old age had ended to his
liking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hemans, in a short historical poem, tenderly touches on the
sorrow of King Henry for the lost prince; and, as I have not alluded
to that sorrow in a very charitable spirit, I will quote the stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<h3>TOMMY TOBY&rsquo;S STORY OF THE FROLICSOME DUKE.</h3>

<p>Tom Toby&rsquo;s turn came next, and at the announcement of his name
there was a sudden lighting up of faces. Tom&rsquo;s face, which was usually
rather comical, assumed a more mirth-loving expression than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that we were to visit Ghent and Bruges.
I believe these towns were in old Flanders, and that Flanders was in
Burgundy. One of the most clever rulers of whom I ever read was
Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, though he had some faults when
he used to be young like me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good Duke married Eleonora, sister to the King of Portugal.
The wedding was celebrated in great pomp at Bruges, and the merry-makings
lasted a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
&ldquo;Christopher Sly was a tinker, and a tinker was a man who used to
&lsquo;roam the countries around,&rsquo; crying, &lsquo;Old brass to mend!&rsquo; and who
repaired the good people&rsquo;s broken pots and kettles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher heard of the great wedding in his travels, and came to
Bruges to enjoy the merry-making with the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had only one pair of breeches, and they were made of leather.
He deemed them suitable for all occasions. He had never arrived at
the luxury of a coat, but in its place he wore a large leather apron,
which covered his great shoulders, like the armor of a knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher had one bad habit. He loved ale overmuch, and he
used to drink so deeply on festive occasions as to affect the steadiness
both of his mind and body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher enjoyed the gala-days. He mingled in the gay
processions that followed the ducal pair to the tournament; he gazed
with loyal pride on the horses with their trappings of crimson and gold;
he followed the falconers to the hunting-parks, and listened to the music
that led the dance at night in the torch-lit palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ducal wedding took place in the deep of winter; and one night,
soon after the joyful event, and while Bruges was yet given up to
festivities, there fell a great snow-storm, blocking the streets and silencing
the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher&rsquo;s money was gone, and the falling weather chilled not
only his blood, but his spirits. He wandered about in the storm, going
from ale-house to ale-house, and receiving hospitality, until the town of
Bruges seemed to revolve around him as its inhabitants around the
Duke. Still he plodded away through the streets, longing to see the
warm fires glow and the torches gleam in the ducal palace. When he
had nearly reached the palace, the town began to spin and whirl around
him at such a rate that presently he sank in the chilly snow and knew
no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am tired of the palace,&rsquo; said the Duke to some courtiers. &lsquo;Let
us go into the streets this blustering night: it may be that we shall
meet with an adventure.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Duke, with a few muffled followers, glided out of one of the
palace gates, and the gleamings of their lanterns shot down the street.
Presently the Duke stumbled over some object, lying half-buried in
the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A dead man,&rsquo; answered a courtier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A drunken tinker,&rsquo; answered an attendant, turning over the body
of a man lying like a log in the snow. &lsquo;How he snores! Dead drunk,
as I live!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He would perish here before morning,&rsquo; said the Duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo; asked a courtier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take him to the palace, and we will have some sport with him.
I will cause him to be washed and dressed and perfumed, and to be
laid in a chamber of state. He will awake sober in the morning, when
we will persuade him that <em>he</em> is the Duke, and that we are his attendants.
To-morrow the whole Court of Burgundy shall serve a poor tinker!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The attendants carried the unconscious tinker to the palace, where
they washed him, and, putting upon him an elegant night-dress, laid
him on a silk-curtained bed, in a very gorgeous chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor tinker, on waking in the morning, looked about the
room in wonder. He concluded that he must be dreaming, or that he
had become touched in mind, or that he had died the night before and
had been so happy as to get to heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, the Duke entered the apartment in the habit of the ducal
chamberlain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What will your Worship have this morning?&rsquo; asked the Duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tinker stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Has your Worship no commands?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am Christopher Sly,&mdash;Sly, the tinker. Call me not your
Worship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You have not fully recovered yet, I see. But you will be yourself
again soon. What suit will your Worship wear to-day? Which
doublet, and what stockings and shoes?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">AMAZEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER SLY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than
legs, nor more shoes than feet; nay, sometime, more feet than shoes.
I tell you I am Christopher Sly, and I am a tinker,&rsquo; was the puzzled
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the ducal chamberlain only bowed the more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sly continued to look about him in amazement. At last, he said,
with much hesitation,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may bring me my best suit. The day is pleasant. I will
dress becomingly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now you are yourself again. I must hasten to inform the Court
of your recovery. I must fly to her Grace the Duchess, and say, &ldquo;The
Duke, the Duke is himself again!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Duke! I tell you I am Christopher Sly,&mdash;old Sly&rsquo;s son, of
Burton Heath,&mdash;by birth a peddler and by trade a tinker. Duke Sly!
No. Duke Christopher! or, better, Duke Christophero! Marry,
friend! wouldn&rsquo;t that sound well? It may be I am a duke, for all.
Go ask Marian Hacket, the buxom inn-keeper of Wincot, if she don&rsquo;t
know Christopher Sly,&mdash;Duke Christophero; and if she say I do not
owe her fourteen pence for small ale, then call me the biggest liar and
knave in Christendom!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The servants presently brought the poor tinker a silver basin, &lsquo;full
of rose-water, and bestrewed with flowers.&rsquo; Then they brought him a
suit of crimson, trimmed with lace and starred. The bewildered fellow
stared awhile in silence; then he slowly put on the gorgeous apparel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tinker next was conducted to a magnificent banqueting-hall,
where was spread a rich feast. The tables smoked with venison
and sparkled with wine. He was led to a high seat beneath a
canopy of silk and gold, the Duchess following, and seating herself by
his side. Knights and ladies filled the tables, and the tinker began to
feast and to sip wine like a duke indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish&rsquo;&mdash;said he, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is your wish?&rsquo; asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish that old Stephen Sly was here, and John Naps and Peter
Turf, and my wife Joan, and Marian Hacket: wouldn&rsquo;t it be jolly?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christopher had never smacked his lips over such wine before,
and he drank so deeply that his ideas became mixed again. The feast
ended. The ladies sung and the musicians played, but Christopher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
continued drinking as long as he could hold a beaker. He began to be
sleepy, and presently tumbled from his high seat beneath the silken
canopy to the floor,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Where he sleeping did snore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being seven times drunker than ever before.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;And here the reign of Duke Christophero came to a sudden end.
The real Duke ordered the attendants to take him away, and to put
upon him his &lsquo;old leather garments again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;When the night is well advanced,&rsquo; said the Duke, &lsquo;take him back
to the place where we found him, and there watch his behavior when
he awakes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Christopher Sly woke in the morning to find his glory gone.
The sun shone on the snow-covered gables of Bruges. He looked
around him with woe in his face, as he saw the snow beneath him
instead of a couch of down, and the sky above him, instead of a silken
canopy, sprinkled with gold. He snuffed the frosty air, and, heaving
a deep groan, he said, &lsquo;And I am old Stephen Sly&rsquo;s son, after all.
I have seen a vision. I will go home, and take my scolding from
Joan.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we visit Bruges,&rdquo; added Tommy, &ldquo;I hope we may all visit
the resting-place of Duke Christopher Sly.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">Tommy&rsquo;s story, although not of great value to the young travellers,
was loudly applauded by the Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said Wyllys, &ldquo;that there is a spire in Bruges four
hundred and fifty feet high, and a tower that contains forty-eight bells;
but I never heard before of Duke Christopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn, who spoke French well and took a lively interest in
French poetry, sang a Norman seaside song, which is a favorite in
some of the coast towns, and is especially employed by the fishermen of
&Eacute;tretat, when a ship goes out to sea in a storm. It began&mdash;</p>

<p>The selection was a rare one, and was mentioned by Master Lewis
as being exceptionally creditable.</p>

<p>George Howe and Leander Towle presented acceptable exercises
on &ldquo;Norman Industries&rdquo; and &ldquo;Peasant Customs.&rdquo; The last topic
seemed to excite Tommy Toby to try to throw some farther light on
this romantic and interesting country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to know what lovely-looking creatures these
Norman peasant girls are, and how they look?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, they
look [going to the blackboard and drawing with a crayon a moment]
just like those.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;I am very gratified,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;at the amount of historic
study our proposed tour has already stimulated. One must read and
study <em>to see</em>. Dr. Johnson used the comparison that &lsquo;some people
would see more in a single ride in a Hempstead stage-coach than others
would in a tour round the world.&rsquo; Thoreau said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have added many charming stories to those already
told. In Calais, the last town of the Gallic dominions of the Plantagenets,
we shall visit the scene of the siege of Edward III. and of the
immortal Five who offered their lives as a ransom for their city, and
whom good Queen Philippa spared. At Falaise, we may see the ruin
of the castle from whose window Duke Robert, the father of the Conqueror,
first saw Arletta, the tanner&rsquo;s daughter, and was enchanted with
her beauty. At Rouen, we shall stand in the square where the Maid
of Orleans was burned, and, in all places, in contrast with the dark
romances of the past, will appear sunny hills, bowery valleys, and
picturesque streams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was Victor Hugo who said that &lsquo;Europe was the finest
nation on the earth, France the finest country, and Normandy the
finest part of France.&rsquo; I do not ask you to accept his opinion, but
Normandy is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meetings of the Club were held every two weeks.</p>

<p>The boys tried to learn the secret which Tommy had been instructed
to select. But he claimed that he had been instructed also
to keep it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not be creditable to the Club to tell it now,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The Steerage.&mdash;Pilot Boats.&mdash;Tommy meets Rough Weather.&mdash;His Letter and

of Arc.&mdash;Signalling at Sea.&mdash;Land!</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dca01"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>N ocean steamer! Though a speck upon the waters,
what a world it seems! What symmetry, what
strength, what a triumph of human skill! What a
cheerful sense of security one feels as one looks upon
the oak and the iron, and hears the wind whistle
through the motionless forest of cordage! There
society in all its grades is seen, and human nature in all its phases.</p>

<p>The cool upper deck of the steamer was more inviting to our
tourists than the hot streets and hotels of New York, and early in the
afternoon they met on the North River Pier, and went on board of their
ocean home. First, they examined the elegant saloons, then their
snug state-rooms, and at last the steerage apartment, where George
and Leander were to have their quarters.</p>

<p>The steerage was not a wholly uninviting apartment. It was a
plain cabin, amidships, well lighted and ventilated, and very clean. A
stanch-looking pair of stairs led down to it. On each side were bunks
in little rooms; those on the right hand for women, and on the left for
men. These were lighted and aired by port-holes. Each passenger
provided his own bedding and eating utensils.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like this,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby to the steward. &ldquo;Are the passengers
here more likely to be sick than in the first cabin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the steward. &ldquo;This is the steadiest part of the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then what is the difference between the cabin and the steerage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the difference is in the folks, and the furniture, and the way
you eat your victuals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steerage passengers were allowed the freedom of the decks, but
not of the grand saloons. Master Lewis and the boys seated themselves
in a group on the upper deck, when they had well visited the
different parts of the ship.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, the immense ship moved slowly and steadily
away from the sultry wharves into the calm sea and cool air. The
great city with its gleaming spires seemed sinking in the sea, and the
hills of Neversink to be burying themselves in the shadows.</p>

<p>Pilot boats several times crossed the track of the steamer, with their
numbers conspicuously painted on their sails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does a captain, who navigates a ship across the ocean,&rdquo; asked
Frank of Master Lewis, &ldquo;need the assistance of pilots and pilot-boats
when he is in sight of land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is because the harbor is more dangerous than the open ocean,
and pilots make these dangers the study of their lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See yonder pilot-boat skimming with the grace of a sea-bird along
the sea. It has the stanchness of a ship built for the longest voyages.
It is doubtless made of the best oak, is sheathed with the best copper,
and may have cost twenty thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The life of a pilot must be an adventurous one,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;and
there must be also much pleasure in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It requires special education and hard training to become a pilot.
It is expected that the candidate for the position shall have been an
apprentice four years, during which he shall have performed all the
duties of a common sailor, even to the washing of the decks and the
tarring of the rigging. This is his college life. If he is an apt student,
he then obtains a certificate of qualification from a board of commissioners
by whom he has been rigidly examined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pilot-boats themselves are exposed to great dangers in foggy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
weather. A calm comes on, and they cannot move. In this situation,
they are liable to be struck by one of the great iron vessels or ocean
steamers. During the last twenty-five years, some thirty pilot-boats
have been lost on this coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">PILOT-BOAT.</p>

<p>The night was beautiful, calm, cool, starry. In the morning, the
sun rose red from the sea. Land had disappeared. The boys all met
on the deck, in fine health and spirits.</p>

<p>Towards evening, the sea grew rough, and there were premonitions
of sea-sickness among the passengers. Tommy Toby, in an amusing
letter which he wrote to his parents, gave a stereoscopic pen-picture of
the condition of our travellers at this period of the voyage. He afterwards
added a characteristic postscript. We give Tommy&rsquo;s letter and
postscript entire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Parents</span>:</p>

<p>If I can only get safely back to Boston, I will never start on a voyage again.</p>

<p>I knew it would be so. I have been seasick.</p>

<p>The first night and day we had very pleasant weather and a light sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
On the evening of the second day, I was on deck with the boys.</p>

<p>All at once the boat gave a great lurch. Then another. Then another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are getting into rough water,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>Wyllys Wynn, who is a poet, was repeating some beautiful rhymes, when
suddenly he grew white in the face, and said, &ldquo;And so it goes on for several
lines.&rdquo; He meant the poetry. Then he began to wander to and fro in search
of the cabin and his state-room.</p>

<p>Frank Gray began to tell a story, but stopped short, and said, &ldquo;The rest of
it is like unto <em>that</em>!&rdquo; He meant the rest of the story. Then he went to the
cabin, &ldquo;making very crooked steerage,&rdquo; one of the deck-hands said.</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn followed him, in the same strange gait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Zigzag Club,&rdquo; said the deck-hand. He was a very sarcastic man.</p>

<p>The ship gave another dreadful lurch, and I began to feel very strange.</p>

<p>I went to my state-room. I felt worse on the way.</p>

<p>The ship seemed to have lost all her steadiness.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the night that followed. The ship creaked, and seemed
just about to roll over after every lurch. Sometimes she went up. I was so
dizzy, it seemed to me that she went up almost to the moon. Then she came
down. She always came down. It seemed to me she must be going down to
the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>In the morning, the steward came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;as been a &rsquo;eavy blow, ruther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A heavy blow!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Did you ever know any thing like it in your
life? Do you think we shall ever see land again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; alarmin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the steward.</p>

<p>A dreadful day followed. I did not leave my room. I wished I had never
left home. I felt like the Frenchman who said, &ldquo;I would kees ze land, if I could
only see any land to kees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day I was better, only there was a light feeling in my head.</p>

<p>I went up on deck. The sun was shining. The wind blew, but the air was
very refreshing.</p>

<p>This is the fourth day out. I have been able to eat to-day. I am feeling
very hungry.</p>

<p>I find that all the boys have been obliged to keep their rooms, except George
Howe, who is in the steerage.</p>

<p>How fearful I am we shall have another night like <em>that</em>! How glad I shall
be to see land again! The land is the place, after all. I wish I were sure we
would have good weather, when we return.</p>

<p class="sig">Your thoughtful son,<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Thomas Toby.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
P. S. Three days after. I am well now. I never felt so bright and happy in
my life. The steward says that people are seldom sick twice during the same
voyage. An ocean trip is just the thing, after all.</p>
</div>

<p>There were a few rather odd characters among the passengers:
among them a portly, self-satisfied Englishman, returning from a tour
of the States, with an increased respect for fine old English society; a
glib-tongued Frenchman, who was delighted with &ldquo;Ze States,&mdash;deelight&eacute;d!&rdquo;
and whose talk was like a row of exclamation points; and a
sentimental Italian fiddler, in very poor dress, going back to the
beauties of Naples and the dreamy airs and skies of &ldquo;Etalee.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/zje023.jpg" width="422" height="200"
alt="Two of our fellow travellers" />
</div>

<p>Tommy Toby seemed to gravitate towards these people, when his
sea-sickness was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I likes zis American poy,&rdquo; said the Frenchman. &ldquo;Intelegent!
Has ze activitee; agilitee; very great prom-ese!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our country must be very different from yours,&rdquo; said Tommy, one
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Veery, veery different indeed! Wonderful countree,&mdash;delightful!
What grand rivers! what waterfalls,&mdash;Niag-e-ra! what lakes! Room
for all ze world! Hospitalitee for all ze nations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Frenchman says our country is the most wonderful in all the
world,&rdquo; said Tommy to the portly Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
The latter looked very solemn; seemed about to speak, then made a
long pause as though the opinion he was about to utter was a very
weighty one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poverty to riches, riches to poverty; now up, now down, but the
animating principle always the same,&mdash;riches, riches. Wonderful
people! progress! each one living to outdo
the other. To-day an alderman, to-morrow
in the penitentiary; to-day my Lady of
Lynne, to-morrow John o&rsquo; the Scales&rsquo;s
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy had an idea of what his lugubrious
acquaintance meant to say, though
the latter&rsquo;s wisdom was rather above his
intellectual stature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no castles in America,&rdquo; said
Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Castles! No; an American family
could not keep a castle: it would be sold
in five years for a mill.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Tommy&rsquo;s face was always very bright
after talking with the Frenchman, but
lengthened out during the interview with
his English friend. He usually retired
discomforted from the latter, to seek comfort in the steerage from the
lively Italian&rsquo;s fiddle.</p>


<p class="hrpad">There was a bright girl on board, named Agnes,&mdash;the daughter of a
Boston gentleman, who was going abroad for a year. She was a social
miss; witty, yet polite; speaking to every one freely, without being
intrusive.</p>

<p>On the evening of the sixth day, nearly all the passengers were in
the saloon. Agnes was asked to sing. She winningly said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will do my best, if agreeable to all.&rdquo; She asked to be excused a
moment, and presently returned with a broad-rimmed hat and a basket,
and wandering carelessly up and down the saloon sang &ldquo;The Beggar
Girl.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Over the mountain, and over the moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hungry and barefoot I wander forlorn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Give me food for my mother, and I will be gone.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Agnes presented her basket to one and another of the passengers,
as if to solicit contributions as the song went on. All were pleased
with the diversion, and it was proposed to have some other amusements
during the evening.</p>

<p>Agnes arranged some impromptu charades: one on <em>Ingratiate</em> (in
grey she ate); another on <em>Cowhiding</em> (cow hiding, in which she personated
a milk-maid calling &ldquo;Co boss, co boss!&rdquo; and afterwards the same
maid cowhiding a boy for hiding her cow). Agnes selected Tommy
Toby to assist her in this last amusing tableau.</p>

<p>Agnes next appeared as a mind-reader. Before this last r&ocirc;le, however,
she was observed having a confidential chat with Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if any of you are interested in clairvoyance, I
shall be pleased to give an exhibition of the science. You may not
know I am a mind-reader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She probably has been reading Master Toby&rsquo;s mind already,&rdquo; said
her father, smilingly looking over his paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If each of you will write a word on a slip of paper, I will have the
slips collected and put on my forehead; and I will take them from my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
forehead one by one, but before I take each one down, I will tell what
is written upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All wrote some word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will some one collect the slips?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think as Thomas Toby is <em>spry</em>, I shall have to ask him to do me
the favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish I were <em>spry</em>!&rdquo; said her father.</p>

<p>The slips were collected. Tommy put them all on her forehead.
She put up her fingers and held them there, and Tommy took a seat
with his friends.</p>

<p>Agnes seemed in reverie. Then she said emphatically,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the first slip is written &lsquo;Boston!&rsquo; Who wrote that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took the slip from her forehead and laid it in her lap, saying as
she did so,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not written very plainly, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So one by one she read all the slips. Each passenger acknowledged
the writing of each announced word, after it had been correctly
given by Agnes. First, the correct readings awakened wonder, then
positive excitement. The experiment was repeated at the request of
all, with the same wonderful result.</p>

<p>The diversion was reproduced on the following evening, and even
Master Lewis failed to see how the girl read the slips. It was noticed,
however, that Tommy Toby always collected the slips, and acknowledged
writing the first word. Agnes also examined each slip closely as
she took it down, as if to verify the results of her very penetrating mind.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">JOAN OF ARC.</p>

<p>The secret of the trick was that Tommy always placed what he had
written at the bottom of the slips, or last; but he acknowledged to have
written what was taken from the forehead first. This gave Agnes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><!-- original location of 'Joan of Arc' --></a></span>

opportunity of reading each slip as she laid it in her lap, and of announcing
what she read as though it were written on the <em>next</em> slip on her
forehead.</p>

<p>One evening, when Master Lewis and the boys were talking of the
historical places they expected to visit, Agnes approached pleasantly
and said, &ldquo;I have a conundrum for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Joan of Arc made of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were unable to guess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell us the story of Joan of Arc, Master Lewis,&rdquo; said
Wyllys. &ldquo;Then, perhaps, we will be able to decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;I should be delighted to hear the
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we expect to visit Rouen, where the Maid of Orleans&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she was Maid of&rdquo;&mdash;said Tommy Toby. &ldquo;I will tell you
after the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Master Lewis related the story of the unfortunate shepherd
girl.</p>


<h3>STORY OF JOAN OF ARC.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, known in history as the Maid of Orleans, was born
in the pleasant village of Domremi, near the borders of Lorraine. Her
parents were peasants, and Jeanne was their fifth child. Her education
was very limited, and she spent her early years as a shepherdess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her soul was full of romance and poetic inspiration, and she led a
dreamy life among the flocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The neighborhood of Domremi abounded in superstitions. Stories
of fairies and demons, beautiful legends of the Virgin, and the
medi&aelig;val traditions of the saints were the themes of fireside hours,
and Jeanne drank deeply into the spirit of these wonderful myths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the age of thirteen, she began to see visions and to dream
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
dreams. She fancied that angel voices whispered in her ear, and that
celestial lights flashed before her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At the age of thirteen,&rsquo; she said, in her defence before the judge
who condemned her to death, &lsquo;I heard a voice in my father&rsquo;s garden
at Domremi, proceeding from the right on the side of the church, accompanied
with a great light. At first I was afraid, but presently found
that it was the voice of an angel, who has protected me ever since, who
has taught me to conduct myself properly, and to frequent the church.
It was Saint Michael.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She continued to hear strange voices. Her father said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Heed them not, Jeanne, it is but a fancy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this state of enthusiasm, she passed some five years among the
vine-clad hills of Domremi, her heart estranged from worldly affections,
and seeking for loving companionship from the beautiful beings that
filled her dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;France, at this period, was rent asunder by civil dissension; the
people of the interior acknowledging Henry VI. of England as their
rightful sovereign, and those of the remoter provinces, Charles VII. of
France. The people of Lorraine adhered to the cause of Charles, and
Jeanne became a politician in girlhood, and aspired to chivalrous deeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When eighteen years of age, she fancied that celestial voices told
her that she was called to deliver her country from English rule, and
to place the young French king upon the throne of his fathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I tell thee, Jeanne, it is a fancy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving her rustic home, the unlettered girl sought an audience of
Captain de Baudricourt, who commanded for Charles at Vaucoleurs.
In this she was successful, and, although he at first treated her as an
idle enthusiast, he was finally so impressed by the recital of her inspirations
and visions, that he sent her to Chinon, where Charles held his
court, to consult with the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None in the world,&rsquo; she said to Baudricourt, &lsquo;can recover the

kingdom of France, there is no hope but in me.&rsquo; She added, &lsquo;I would
far rather be spinning beside my poor mother; but I must do this work,
because my Lord wills it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is your lord?&rsquo; asked the general.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Lord God!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By my faith,&rsquo; said Baudricourt, &lsquo;I will take you to the king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She obtained an interview with Charles, whom she claimed to have
recognized in a promiscuous company by a sudden inspiration, accompanied
by celestial light. The story of her divine appointment deeply
moved the king; and, his cause becoming desperate, he accepted the
services of the fair prophetess, clad her in armor, and placed her at the
head of an army of ten thousand men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something in her very appearance that inspired awe.
Her mien was noble and commanding; her form was tall and
elegant. She controlled her charger with wonderful grace and skill.
By her side was a consecrated sword, found buried in the old church of
St. Catherine de Fierbois, the existence of which she claimed to have
discovered by a special revelation from above; and in her hand she
carried a banner emblazoned with angels and consecrated to God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English troops, with the French allies of Henry, were besieging
Orleans, a famous old city, and one of the strongholds of Charles.
Thither Jeanne led her army. She soon inspired her soldiers with the
conviction that she held a commission from on high; and, when they
arrived before Orleans, they were wrought up to the highest pitch of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeanne attacked the English, and in several engagements displayed
superior generalship and won brilliant victories. The confidence of the
French troops in her now became implicit, and they received her
commands as from a messenger of celestial truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English soldiers, too, were infected by the superstition, and
a panic ensued whenever she appeared. Jeanne was at last completely
victorious, and, although once severely wounded, raised the siege of
Orleans, and entered the city in triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
&ldquo;The French kings for a long period had received their crowns at
Rheims. The city was a great distance from Orleans, and the approaches
to it were held by the English. Thither mysterious voices
directed Jeanne. Charles, yielding to her influence, set out on the long
and perilous journey, to be crowned in the ancient fane where his
ancestors of the house of Valois had received their diadems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English troops retired, and the cause of Charles received a new
impetus wherever the young prophetess and her army appeared. The
journey was a continued triumph for Charles, and when he reached
Rheims, the fame of his success rekindled the fires of patriotism in
every town and province of France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was a joyous day in Rheims of old,&rsquo; when the glittering retinue,
led by the young king and the peasant child, marched to the thronged
cathedral. The coronation services were wonderfully impressive and
inconceivably splendid. The holy unction was performed with oil said
to have been brought from heaven by a dove, to King Clovis. By the
side of the young monarch stood Jeanne in full armor, holding in her
hand her consecrated banner. Triumphant music pealed forth, and
the plaudits of the people made the old cathedral tremble. When the
ceremony was over, Jeanne threw herself at the feet of the king,
embraced his knees and wept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She felt now that her mission was accomplished. She resolved to
return to her home, and to pass her days among the simple peasants of
Domremi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But fame was too dazzling, and ambition tempted her to new
exploits. She was taken prisoner at last by her enemies, the Burgundians,
was delivered over to the English, put upon trial as a sorceress,
pronounced guilty, and condemned to death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wept over her hard fate. &lsquo;I would rather be beheaded than
burned,&rsquo; she said, when she reflected on the manner of her death, which
was to be burned at the stake. &lsquo;Oh, that this body should be reduced
to ashes!&rsquo;</p>

&ldquo;She wept for her country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Rouen, Rouen!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is it here that I must die? Here
shall be my last resting-place.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A huge pile of fuel was made in the ancient market place in
Rouen, and the Maid of Orleans was placed upon it; and in the presence
of a vast concourse of citizens, soldiers and ecclesiastics, she was
burned. Her last words were expressive of inward triumph. The
lamentable event occurred on the last day of May, 1431. Her ashes
were cast into the Seine, and carried to the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joan of Arc was no wilful impostor. She fully believed that she
beheld faces of departed saints, and heard the voices of beings from the
unseen world. The result of her wonderful career was that Charles
ultimately won back to the royal house of Valois the whole kingdom of
France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An imposing mausoleum in the city of Orleans perpetuates her
memory; but her name stands above mortality, independent of marble
or bronze. Apart from her character as a visionary, Jeanne was a most
noble girl. The French still cherish an enthusiastic attachment for
her memory, and a yearly f&ecirc;te is given in honor of her deeds in the
City of Orleans.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby, &ldquo;that I can answer Agnes&rsquo;s conundrum.
Joan of Arc was Maid (made) of Orleans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;What an agreeable company the Zigzag
Club is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One afternoon the man on the lookout called the attention of those
around him to a distant object: it seemed like a mere speck in the
horizon. He presently said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news spread. Every one came upon deck. Even the cooks
in the galley left their pots and kettles.</p>

<p>As she drew near, the British ensign was seen fluttering at the
stern. As she drew still nearer, she hoisted five small flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Then one of the quartermasters on our own ship brought several
small flags and a signal-book from the wheel-house. He opened the
book to a page of colored pictures of small flags, five of which corresponded
to those raised by the ship in view. Opposite each flag was a
figure. The figures combined in order made the number 94,362.</p>

<p>The quartermaster turned to another page, and opposite this number
appeared the name and port of the ship.</p>

<p>The ship hoisted another set of flags, which was answered by our
own ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She asks to know our reckonings,&rdquo; said the quartermaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can a ship meeting another ask other questions
in this way?&rdquo; inquired George Howe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; two vessels miles apart can carry
on a long conversation with each other. Ships
have a regular alphabet of signal flags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are signals of distress?&rdquo; asked
George.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That flag,&rdquo; said the quartermaster, pointing
to a picture in the book, &ldquo;means a fire or
a leak. (1)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This means a want of food. (2)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that, aground. (3)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is one that signifies, &lsquo;Will you take a
letter from me?&rsquo;&rdquo; (4)</p>

<p>This dialogue between the two ships was

voyage, until land began to appear as a dim
streak upon the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="dco01"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>LD Glasgow, almost encircled by hills and uplands,
presents a picturesque view, as the steamer moves
slowly up the narrowing channel of the Clyde.
But with its rapid commercial growth, its 2,000,000
spindles, its steam-power, and its busy marts of
trade, it is a city of the present rather than the
past, and beyond the Knox monument and the
Cathedral presents few attractions to the history-loving stranger.</p>

<p>Our tourists stopped at Glasgow to make a day&rsquo;s excursion to
the home of Burns. They were taken from the boat to the Queen&rsquo;s
Hotel in George&rsquo;s Square; but George Howe and Leander Towle
after resting with the rest of the party, secured lodgings in a private
house.</p>

<p>The boys arose the next morning, with dreams of the Doon and
Ayr. To their disappointment, a heavy mist hung over the city; and
they found it a dreary and disappointing walk to the South Side
Station, where they were to take the train for Ayr. The two hours&rsquo;
ride on the train was as colorless; they were whirled through a novel
and beautiful summer landscape, but Nature had dropped her sea-curtain
and sky-curtain of fog and mist over all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
When the party arrived at Ayr, it was raining. The boys&rsquo; faces, too,
were cloudy, and each one pressed Master Lewis with the question,
&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy Toby at last answered the rather embarrassing question
with, &ldquo;Let us consult the barometer.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 363px;">

</div>

<p>The barometer, too, wore a cloudy face, and frowned at them, as
though it meant never to predict fine weather again.</p>

<p>But, after waiting awhile at the station, there were signs of lifting
clouds and clearing skies. A weather-wise old Scotchman promised
the party a fair day, and bid them &ldquo;God speed&rdquo; for the home of &ldquo;Robbie
Burns.&rdquo; Presently, the sun began to shoot his lances through the mist,
and the tourists set out for their first walk, which was to be a two-mile
one, to Burns&rsquo;s cottage.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">BIRTHPLACE OF ROBERT BURNS.</p>

<p>The cottage was indeed an humble one. It was built by the father
of Burns, with his own hands, before his marriage, and originally contained
two rooms.</p>

<p>In the interior of the kitchen, a Scotchwoman showed to the party
a recess where</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The bard peasant first drew breath.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The simplicity of the place and its ennobling associations seemed to
touch all except Tommy, who remarked to Frank Gray,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
&ldquo;I was born in a better room than that myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I fear you never will be called to sing the songs of a nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear I never shall,&rdquo; said Tommy, meekly.</p>

<p>From the cottage, the party went to the Burns monument.</p>

<p>From the base of its columns, the beauties of Scottish scenery began
to appear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the way in which one ends life that honors the place of one&rsquo;s
birth,&rdquo; said Frank to Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; said Tommy, as the sun came out and covered the
beautiful monument, and illuminated the record of the poet&rsquo;s fame.</p>

<p>The tourists, under the direction of a Scottish farmer, whose acquaintance
Master Lewis had made, next proceeded to an eminence
commanding a view of the mansion house of Coilsfield, the romance-haunting
Castle of Montgomery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Scotchman, &ldquo;lived Burns&rsquo;s first sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Highland Mary?&rdquo; asked several voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were separated by death,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;Can you tell
us the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Mary was expecting soon to be wedded to Burns, she went to
visit her kin in Argyleshire. She met Burns for the last time on a
Sunday in May. It was a lovely day, and standing one on the one side
and one on the other of a small brook, and holding a Bible between
them, they promised to be true to each other for ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the journey, Mary fell sick and died. You have read Burns&rsquo;s
lines &lsquo;To Mary in Heaven&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to hear me try &lsquo;Highland Mary&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, who was always affected by ballad
music.</p>

<p>The Scotchman quoted a line or two of the poem, changing from
the English to the Scottish accent. The boys were charmed with the
words, and sat down on the grass to listen to</p>

The &ldquo;banks and braes and streams around&rdquo; gleamed like a vision
of enchantment in the full noon sunlight. Never had the boys listened
to a song amid such highly romantic associations.</p>

<p>Bidding the entertaining Scotchman farewell, the party returned
to Ayr, and thence to Glasgow, where it arrived in the lingering
sunlight of the long afternoon.</p>

<p>The next morning it left by rail for Edinburgh, that city of high
houses and terraced hills; of grandly picturesque beauty; of the times
of Bruce, and the bright and dark days of the Stuarts; where one
is surrounded by the relics of a thousand years, and stands under
the protecting shadow of a castle that seems lifted into the regions
of air.</p>

<p>The party took rooms on Prince&rsquo;s Street, a thoroughfare one hundred
feet wide and a mile in length, graced with noble monuments of
art and bowery pleasure-grounds. It is considered one of the most
picturesque streets in the world.</p>

<p>Around you are shops with splendid windows, statues, public gardens,
birds, and flowers; above you are houses six or eight stories
high; above these, on the rocky hillsides, are queer old buildings of
other times; and high over all is the Castle, cold and grand on its rocky
throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall rest to-morrow, boys,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;and shall let you
roam at will. Let us spend the evening in one of the public gardens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After supper, the party went to one of these fragrant street-gardens.
The band of the Duchess of Sutherland&rsquo;s Own, as a certain Highland
regiment is called, filled the quiet air with delicious music.</p>

<p>The sun withdrew his light from the street, the gardens, and the tall
houses on the hills, but the Castle stood long in the mellowed glory of
the sunset.</p>

<p>But the sun left even the Castle at last, and then began a spectacle
that seemed like an illusion or fairy-land.</p>

above them. Now and then a whole face of an antique pile was
illuminated; now some little eyrie that seemed hanging in air burst
into flame; now a line of terraces began to twinkle. The lights crept
up the hillsides everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw any thing so beautiful!&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn.</p>

<p>Every one talks of the Castle in Edinburgh, and the boys paid their
first visit to it, and saw it in its morning glory. On the highest platform
of the Castle, three hundred and eighty-three feet above the sea,
stands the celebrated old cannon Mons Meg, made in Mons, in Brittany,
in 1486. It had figured in so many wars and historic scenes, that
the Scottish people came to regard it as a national relic. The site of
the Castle is about seven hundred feet in circumference, and on three
sides it seems just a bare rock, rising almost perpendicularly in air.</p>

them about the place, &ldquo;is

<p>They were told that a
certain stain in the floor
was the blood of the hapless

said Wyllys Wynn, when the party with Master Lewis were at tea.</p>

haunt of Thomas the Rhymer, and the residence of Walter Scott.</p>

<p>They were met at the entrance of the gray mansion by a tall
Scotchman, and were taken from the magnificent entrance hall, about
forty feet in length, to the dining-room, which has a wonderful black-oak
roof, and is the place where Sir Walter died. Gazing from the
window on the beautiful landscape for the last time, he said to Lockhart,
&ldquo;Bring me a book.&rdquo; &ldquo;What book?&rdquo; &ldquo;There is but one book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were next shown the library, a repository of some twenty
thousand books and of presents from most eminent persons, among
them a silver urn from Lord Byron and two arm-chairs from the Pope.</p>

<p>Our tourists next visited the ruin of Melrose Abbey, and found it
less interesting than its historic associations. Late evening found them
again in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time of the evening do you think it is?&rdquo; asked Master
Lewis of the boys as they entered the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>The Castle still stood in the damask light of the twilight, like a
dark picture on an illuminated curtain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The summer days in these Northern regions are as long as they
are beautiful,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<h3>STORY OF QUEEN MARY AND RIZZIO.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mary, Queen of Scots, was perhaps the most beautiful in person
and winning in manners and polite accomplishments of any modern
queen. She was the daughter of James V. of Scotland and Mary of
Lorraine. Her father heard of her birth on his death-bed. He had
hoped his heir would prove a son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It came with a lass, and it will end with a lass,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crown of Scotland came with the daughter of Bruce, and
ended with unfortunate Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary became queen before she was a week old. Little she knew,
in her innocent cradle at Linlithgow, of the crown waiting her head or
the kingdom that was ruled in her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her childhood was like a fairy story. She had there Marys for
playmates, as she herself was named Mary; and each Mary was the
daughter of a noble family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When six years of age she was given in marriage to Francis II.,
the son of the French King. The French fleet carried her away
from the rugged shores of Scotland, and the Scottish Marys went with
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten years were passed amid the gayeties and splendors of the
French court, and then, at the age of sixteen, she was married, amid
great pomp and rejoicings, to the Dauphin, whose courtly devotion and
elegant society she had long enjoyed. The associations of the young
pair before marriage had been very happy. They delighted to be with
each other even in society, when they would often separate themselves
from the gay throngs around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next year found Francis on the throne, and Mary seemed to
be the happiest queen in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the following year the young king died, childless, and Mary
was compelled to return to Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
&ldquo;She sailed from Calais in the late summer of another changeful
year. She wept when the shores of France faded from her sight, and
expressed her regret in a tender poem, which you may have read.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 364px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mary was a Catholic. Scotland had adopted the Reformed Faith,
and the Scots received her with coldness and suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s life from childhood to her imprisonment was a series of
romances associated with marriage schemes. Francis had not been
long dead before many of the courts of Europe were planning marriage
alliances with the beautiful Queen. The kings of France, Sweden,
Denmark, Don Carlos of Spain, the Archduke of Austria, and many
others of lesser rank were named as suitable candidates for her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her own choice fell upon her handsome cousin, Lord Darnley,
who was a Catholic, and among the nearest heirs to the English crown.
He was a weak, corrupt, ambitious man. But he had a winning face,
and the marriage was celebrated in Holyrood Palace, in the summer
of 1565.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, long before this marriage, as Mary was coming down the
stairs of the Palace, she saw the graceful form of a dark Italian
musician reclining on a piece of carved furniture in the hall. It was
her first view of David Rizzio, who had come to Scotland in the train
of the embassador from Savoy. In a celebrated picture of Mary, she is
represented as starting back in surprise and horror at the sight of this
adventurer, as though the moment were one of fate and evil foreboding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This fascinating Italian won the confidence of Mary by his arts,
and used his influence to bring about the marriage with Darnley. He
became a friend of Darnley: they occupied the same apartments and
engaged in the same political intrigues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after the marriage, Rizzio himself drew away the affections of
the Queen from Darnley, who determined to assassinate Rizzio.
Several Scottish lords united with Darnley to do the deed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, when Mary had been supping with Rizzio, the white
face of Lord Ruthven appeared at the door of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let <em>him</em> come out of the room,&rsquo; he said to the Queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He shall not leave the room,&rsquo; said the Queen; &lsquo;I read his danger
in your face.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then Ruthven and his followers rushed upon Rizzio, dragged
him from the room, and stabbed him fifty-six times. You have seen
the blood-stains in the Palace, where the wily Italian was killed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that his body was thrown upon the same chest, at the
foot of the stairs, where Mary had seen him first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary knew that Darnley had caused the murder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will now have my revenge,&rsquo; she said, in the presence of the
conspirators.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said to Darnley, &lsquo;I will cause you to have as sorrowful a heart
as I have now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For political reasons she, however, became seemingly reconciled to
him. Three months after the tragedy, James VI. of Scotland and I.
of England was born. You have seen his birthplace to-day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve months passed. Earl Bothwell, a profligate noble, had
won the Queen&rsquo;s confidence. There is little doubt that the two formed
a plot to destroy Darnley&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen went to visit Darnley at Glasgow, he having fallen ill.
She pretended great affection for him, and brought him to Edinburgh,
and secured lodgings for him in a private house. She left him late one
Sunday evening, to attend a marriage feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She remarked to him, in one of their last interviews,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was about this time, a year ago, I believe, that David was
murdered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After she had gone, there was a great explosion, and Darnley&rsquo;s
dead body was found in a neighboring garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary had had her revenge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three months after the tragedy she married Bothwell, who had
secured a divorce from his young wife to prepare the way for the event.</p>

<p class="caption">FRANCIS II. AND MARY STUART LOVE-MAKING.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scotland rose against Mary. She fled to England, and threw herself
on the protection of Elizabeth, abdicating the throne in favor of
her son. She was secured as a prisoner, and confined at Carlisle. She
was taken from Carlisle to Fotheringhay Castle. She was at last tried

for conspiracy against the life of Elizabeth. Sentence of death was
passed upon her. She protested her innocence. You know the rest,&mdash;the
last tragedy of all, in the Castle of Fotheringhay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bothwell died an exile and a madman, some nine years after his
marriage with Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that it was found, after her execution, that her real hair,
under her wig, was as white as that of a woman of seventy. I cannot
wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had one little friend who remained true to the last. It was
her little dog. He followed her to the block, and cowered, frightened,
under her dress, at the fatal moment, and lay down beside her headless
body when the last tragedy was over. It could not be driven away
from its mistress; and when the body was removed it began to droop,
as though understanding its loss, and in two days it died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have spoken at school a poem by Bulwer Lytton, founded on
the incident,&rdquo; said Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you now repeat it?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="i0">It does not know that kindness dies, and love departs from death.<br /></span>

<p>Master Lewis continued the general subject of the meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Frank, has been the most interesting object you have
seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Cannongate. I read its history in the guide-book, and I
spent an hour in the place. One could seem in fancy to live there
hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King James rode through this street on his way to Flodden,&rdquo; said
Master Lewis. &ldquo;Montrose was dragged here upon a hurdle. It was
in a church here that Jenny Geddes bespoke the sentiment of the
people by hurling her stool at the head of the Dean, who attempted to
enforce the Episcopal service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will read the Collect,&rsquo; said the Dean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Colic, said ye? The De&rsquo;il colic the wame of ye!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here came John Knox, after his interview with Queen Mary, cold
and grim, and unmoved by her tears. Here rode the Pretender.
Here dwelt the great Dukes of Scotland and the Earls of Moray and
Mar.&rdquo;</p>

slowly, and that almost every gable recalled to him some scene of
triumph or of bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot begin to tell you stories of Cannongate,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis. &ldquo;Such stories would fill volumes, and give a view of the whole
of Scottish history. What, Ernest, has impressed you most?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The view of Edinburgh at night is the most beautiful sight I have
seen. But the charm that Scott&rsquo;s poetry has given to Melrose Abbey,
haunts me still, notwithstanding my disappointment at the ruin. This
was the tomb of the Douglases and of the heart of Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a story of one of the Douglases, whose castle still
stands, not far from Melrose,&rdquo; said Master Lewis; &ldquo;a story which
I think is one of the most pleasing of the Border Wars. I will call
the story</p>


<h3>THE BLACK DOUGLAS.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;King Edward I. of England nearly conquered Scotland. They
did not have photographs in those days, but had expressive and descriptive
names for people of rank, which answered just as well. So Edward
was known as &lsquo;Longshanks.&rsquo; It was from no lack of spirit or energy
that he did not quite complete the stubborn work; but he died a little
too soon. On his death-bed he called his pretty, spiritless son to him,
and made him promise to carry on the war; he then ordered that his
body should be boiled in a caldron, and that his bones should be
wrapped up in a bull&rsquo;s hide, and carried at the head of the army in
future campaigns against the Scots. After these and some other queer
requests, death relieved him of the hard politics of this world, and so he
went away. Then his son, Edward II., tucked away the belligerent old
King&rsquo;s bones among the bones of other old kings in Westminster
Abbey, and spent his time in dissipation among his favorites, and
allowed the resolute Scots to recover Scotland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good James, Lord Douglas, was a very wise man in his day. He
may not have had long shanks, but he had a very long head, as you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
shall presently see. He was one of the hardest foes with whom the
two Edwards had to contend, and his long head proved quite too
powerful for the second Edward, who, in his single campaign against
the Scots, lost at Bannockburn nearly all that his father had gained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tall Scottish Castle of Roxburgh stood near the border, lifting
its grim turrets above the Teviot and the Tweed. When the Black
Douglas, as Lord James was called, had recovered castle after castle
from the English, he desired to gain this stronghold, and determined to
accomplish his wish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he knew it could be taken only by surprise, and a very wily
ruse it must be. He had outwitted the English so many times that
they were sharply on the lookout for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could it be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near the castle was a gloomy old forest, called Jedburgh. Here,
just as the first days of spring began to kindle in the sunrise and sunsets,
and warm the frosty hills, Black Douglas concealed sixty picked
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Shrove-tide, and Fasten&rsquo;s Eve, immediately before the great
Church festival of Lent, was to be celebrated with a great gush of music
and blaze of light and free offerings of wine in the great hall of the
castle. The garrison was to have leave for merry-making and indulging
in drunken wassail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun had gone down in the red sky, and the long, deep shadow
began to fall on Jedburgh woods, the river, the hills, and valleys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An officer&rsquo;s wife had retired from the great hall, where all was
preparation for the merry-making, to the high battlements of the castle,
in order to quiet her little child and put it to rest. The sentinel, from
time to time, paced near her. She began to sing,&mdash;</p>

the distance. They greatly puzzled her. They did not travel quite
like animals, but they seemed to have four legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are those queer-looking things yonder?&rsquo; she asked of the
sentinel as he drew near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are Farmer Asher&rsquo;s cattle,&rsquo; said the soldier, straining his
eyes to discern the outlines of the long figures in the shadows. &lsquo;The
good man is making merry to-night, and has forgotten to bring in his
oxen; lucky &rsquo;t will be if they do not fall a prey to the Black Douglas.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So sure was he that the objects were cattle that he ceased to
watch them longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s eye, however, followed the queer-looking cattle for
some time, until they seemed to disappear under the outer works of the
castle. Then, feeling quite at ease, she thought she would sing again.
Spring was in the evening air; it may have made her feel like singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the name of the Black Douglas had become so terrible to the
English that it proved a bugbear to the children, who, when they misbehaved,
were told that the Black Douglas would get them. The little
ditty I have quoted must have been very quieting to good children in
those alarming times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the good woman sang cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hush ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little pet ye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not fret ye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Black Douglas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not get ye!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Do not be so sure of that!</span>&rsquo; said a husky voice close beside
her, and a mail-gloved hand fell solidly upon her shoulder. She was
dreadfully frightened, for she knew from the appearance of the man he
must be the Black Douglas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Scots came leaping over the walls. The garrison was merry-making
below, and, almost before the disarmed revellers had any warning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
the Black Douglas was in the midst of them. The old stronghold
was taken, and many of the garrison were put to the sword; but the
Black Douglas spared the woman and the child, who probably never
afterward felt quite so sure about the little ditty,&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">THE BLACK DOUGLAS SURPRISING AN ENEMY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas had caused his picked men to approach the castle by
walking on their hands and knees, with long black cloaks thrown over
their bodies, and their ladders and weapons concealed under their
cloaks. The men thus presented very nearly the appearance of a herd
of cattle in the deep shadows, and completely deceived the sentinel, who
was probably thinking more of the music and dancing below than of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
the watchful enemy who had been haunting the gloomy woods of
Jedburgh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Douglas, or &lsquo;Good James, Lord Douglas,&rsquo; as he was
called by the Scots, fought, as I have already said, with King Robert
Bruce at Bannockburn. One lovely June day, in the far-gone year of
1329, King Robert lay dying. He called Douglas to his bedside,
and told him that it had been one of the dearest wishes of his heart
to go to the Holy Land and recover Jerusalem from the Infidels; but
since he could not go, he wished him to embalm his heart after his
death, and carry it to the Holy City and deposit it in the Holy
Sepulchre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas had the heart of Bruce embalmed and inclosed in a silver
case, and wore it on a silver chain about his neck. He set out for
Jerusalem, but resolved first to visit Spain and engage in the war
waged against the Moorish King of Grenada. He fell in Andalusia, in
battle. Just before his death, he threw the silver casket into the thickest
of the fight, exclaiming, &lsquo;Heart of Bruce! I follow thee or die!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His dead body was found beside the casket, and the heart of Bruce
was brought back to Scotland and deposited in the ivy-clad Abbey
of Melrose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Douglas was a real hero, and few things more engaging than his
exploits were ever told under the holly and mistletoe, or in the warm
Christmas light of the old Scottish Yule-logs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has interested you most in Scotland?&rdquo; said Master Lewis to
George Howe, continuing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hardly interested in antiquities at all,&rdquo; said George, frankly.
&ldquo;I try to be, but it is not in me. A living factory is more to my taste
than a dead museum. The most interesting things I have seen are
the great Glasgow factories. As for stories, I have been thinking of
one that has more force for me than all the legends I ever read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be glad to hear you tell it,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;My
business is teaching, and it is my duty to stimulate a love of literature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
But I have all respect for a boy with mechanical taste; no lives
promise greater usefulness. We will listen to George&rsquo;s story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not a romantic story,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;I will call it</p>


<h3>A GLASGOW FACTORY BOY.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Just above the wharves of Glasgow, on the banks of the Clyde,
there once lived a factory boy, whom I will call Davie. At the age of
ten he entered a cotton factory as &lsquo;piecer.&rsquo; He was employed from six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning till eight at night. His parents were very poor,
and he well knew that his must be a boyhood of very hard labor. But
then and there, in that buzzing factory, he resolved that he would
obtain an education, and would become an intelligent and a useful man.
With his very first week&rsquo;s wages he purchased &lsquo;Ruddiman&rsquo;s Rudiments
of Latin,&rsquo; He then entered an evening school that met between the
hours of eight and ten. He paid the expenses of his instruction out of
his own hard earnings. At the age of sixteen he could read Virgil and
Horace as readily as the pupils of the English grammar schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He next began a course of self-instruction. He had been advanced
in the factory from a &lsquo;piecer&rsquo; to the spinning-jenny. He
brought his books to the factory, and placing one of them on the
&lsquo;jenny,&rsquo; with the lesson open before him, he divided his attention
between the running of the spindles and rudiments of knowledge. He
now began to aspire to become a preacher and a missionary, and to
devote his life in some self-sacrificing way to the good of mankind. He
entered Glasgow University. He knew that he must work his way, but
he also knew the power of resolution, and he was willing to make
almost any sacrifice to gain the end. He worked at cotton-spinning
in the summer, lived frugally, and applied his savings to his college
studies in the winter. He completed the allotted course, and at the
close was able triumphantly to say, &lsquo;<em>I never had a farthing that I did
not earn</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy was Dr. David Livingstone.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
&ldquo;An excellent story,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;A sermon in a story,
and a volume of philosophy in a life. Now, Tommy, what is the most
attractive thing <em>you</em> have seen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it now. Oh, look! look!&rdquo; said Tommy, flying to the
window.</p>

<p>The full moon was hanging over the great castle, whitening its
grim turrets.</p>

<p>The boys all gazed upon the scene, which appeared almost too
beautiful for reality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks like a castle in the sky,&rdquo; said Wyllys.</p>

<p>Story-telling was at an end. So the exercises ended with an
exhibition of Edinburgh Castle by moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="dcc01"><span class="dropcap">C</span></span>ARLISLE!&rdquo; said Master Lewis, as the cars stopped at a
busy looking city, the terminus of many lines of railway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carlisle?&rdquo; asked Frank Gray, glancing at the evidences
of business energy about the station. &ldquo;Carlisle? I have
heard that the city was a thousand years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An old city may grow,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, on the way to the
hotel. &ldquo;In 1800, Carlisle had but 4,000 inhabitants, now it has more
than 30,000.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carlisle was the ancient seat of the kings of Cambria, and was a
Roman station in the early days of the Christian era. It was destroyed
in 900 by the Danes, was ravaged by the Picts and Scots, was doubtless
visited by Agricola, Severus, and Hadrian, and it has a part in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
history of all the Border wars. Here half-forgotten kings lived; here
Roman generals made their airy camps, and near it the grotesque ships
of Roman emperors dropped their sails in the Solway. Here Christianity
made an early advent, and the hideous rites of the Druid priests
disappeared.</p>

<p class="caption">ROMANS INVADING BRITAIN.</p>

<p>The ancient Druids worshipped in sacred groves; the oaks were
their fanes and chapels, but they erected immense stone temples open
to the sky, the moon, and stars: these were their cathedrals. In them
were great stones used as altars of sacrifice, and on their altars the dark
and mysterious priests offered up human victims to their gods.</p>

<p>The country around Carlisle abounds in Roman and Druidical
relics, and in antiquities associated with the Border contests. At Penrith
may be seen the ruins of a Druid temple, formed of sixty-seven
immense stones, called &ldquo;long Meg and her daughters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Isle of Man, the ancient and poetic Mona, whose grand scenery
was once the supposed abode of the gods of the Saxons, lies near the
Solway, and to it excursion steamers go from the western coast towns
of England carrying pleasure seekers all the long summer days. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
the Druids gathered after
the defeat of the
Saxons by the Romans,
and thither the Romans
followed them, and fell
upon the long-bearded
priests and the wild
torch-bearing priestesses,
and put them to
the sword. The island
of Mona may be called
the Druid&rsquo;s sepulchre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the most
quaint and curious of
old English ballads is
associated with Carlisle,
and is founded upon a funny story which illustrates the rude simplicity
of the early English court. The ballad may be found in the Percy
Society&rsquo;s Collections, which you may some day examine in the Boston
Public Library, or indeed in any great library at home or in England.
It is entitled &lsquo;The Jolly Harper Man.&rsquo; I will relate it to you
in the rather decorated style that I once heard it told to a company
of young people at a Christmas gathering in one of the London charity
schools. I hope it will interest you as much now as it did the boys

<h3>THE STORY OF THE JOLLY HARPER MAN AND HIS GOOD FORTUNE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Many, many years ago,&mdash;as long ago as the days of Fair Rosamond,
when Henry Plantagenet and his unruly family governed England,
and some think as long ago as old Henry I.,&mdash;there lived in Scotland
a jolly harper man, who was accounted the most charming player in all
the world. The children followed him in crowds through the streets,
nor could they be stopped while he continued playing; even the animals
in the woods sat on their haunches to listen when he wandered harping
through the country; and the fair daughters of the nobles immediately
fell in love as often as he approached their castles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Henry had a wonderful horse&mdash;a very wonderful horse&mdash;named
<em>Brownie</em>. He did not quite equal in dexterity and intelligence
the high-flying animal of whom you have read in the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo;
but he knew a great deal, and was a sort of philosopher among horses,&mdash;just
as Newton was a philosopher among men. King Henry said
he would not part with him for a province,&mdash;he would rather lose his
crown. In this he was wise, for a new crown could have been as easily
made as a stew-pan; but all the world, it may be, could not produce
such another intelligent horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King Henry had fine stables built for the animal,&mdash;a sort of horse
palace. They were very strong, and were fastened by locks, and bars,
and bolts, and were kept by gay grooms, and guarded day and night
by soldiers, who never had been known to falter in their devotion to
the interests of the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So strongly was the animal guarded, that it came to be a proverb
among the English yeomanry, that a person could no more do this or
that hard thing than &lsquo;they could steal Brownie from the stables of
the king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king liked the proverb; it was a compliment to his wisdom
and sagacity. It made him feel good,&mdash;so good, in fact, that it led him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
one day quite to overshoot the mark in an effort that he made to increase
the people&rsquo;s high opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If any one,&rsquo; said he, after a good dinner,&mdash;&lsquo;if any one were smart
enough to get Brownie out of his stables without my knowledge, I would
for his cleverness forgive him, and give him an estate to return the
animal.&rsquo; Then he looked very wise, and felt very comfortable and very
secure. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;evil overtake the man who gets caught in
an attempt to steal my horse. Lucky will it be for him if his eyes ever
see the light of the English sun again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the report went abroad that the man who would be so shrewd
as to get possession of the king&rsquo;s horse should have an estate, but that
he who failed in the attempt should lose his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English court, at this time, was at Carlisle, near the Scottish
border. The jolly harper man lived in the old town of Striveling, since
called Stirling, at some distance from the border.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man, like most people of genius, was very poor.
He often played in the castles of the nobles, especially on festive occasions;
and, as he contrasted the luxurious living of these fat lords with
his own poverty, he became suddenly seized with a desire for wealth,
and he remembered the proverb, which was old even then, that &lsquo;Where
there is a will there is a way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One autumn day, as he was travelling along the borders of Loch
Lomond, a famous lake in the middle of Scotland, he remembered that
there was a cave overlooking the lake from a thickly wooded hill, in
which dwelt a hermit, who often was consulted by people in perplexity,
and who bore the name of the &lsquo;Man of Wisdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not a wicked magician, nor did he pretend to have any
dealings with the dead. He was gifted only with what was called
clearness of vision; he could see into the secret of things, just as Zerah
Colburn could see into difficult problems of mathematics, without
study. Things that were darkness to others were as clear as sunlight
to him. He lived on roots and herbs, and flourished so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
wonderfully on the diet, that what he didn&rsquo;t know was considered not
worth knowing.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 422px;">

<img src="images/zje044.jpg" width="422" height="400"
alt="A person walks towards the hermit's dwelling" />
</div>

<p class="caption">THE HERMIT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was near nightfall when the jolly harper man came to the famous
hill. The sun was going down in splendor, and the moon was coming
up, faint and shadowy, and turning into gold as the shadows deepened.
Showers of silver began to fall on Loch Lomond, and to quiver over
the valleys. It was an hour to fill a minstrel&rsquo;s heart with romantic
feeling, and it lent its witchery to the heart of the jolly harper man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wandered up the hill overlooking the lake, where dwelt the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
Man of Wisdom to whose mind all things were clear. He sat down
near the mouth of the cave, partook of his evening meal, then, seizing
his harp, began to play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He played a tune of wonderful sweetness and sadness, so soft and
airy that the notes seemed to glide down the moonbeams, like the
tinkling of fairy bells in the air. The wicked owl pricked up his
ears to listen, and was so overcome that he wished he was a more
respectable bird. The little animals came out of the bushes, and formed
a circle around the jolly harper man, as though enchanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old hermit heard the strain, and came out to listen; and,
because he had clearness of vision, he knew that music of such wonderful
tenderness could be produced only by one who had great gifts of
nature, and who also had some secret longing in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he came up to the jolly harper man, walking with his cane,
his gray beard falling over his bosom, and his long white hair silvered
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man secretly expected him, or at least he hoped
that he would come out. Like the Queen of Sheba, he wished to test
the wisdom of this new Solomon, and to inquire of him if there
were no way of turning his wonderful musical genius into bags of
gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you wander here, my good harper?&rsquo; asked the hermit,
when the last strain melted away in low, airy echoes over the lake.
&lsquo;There are neither lads to dance nor lassies to sing. This hill is my
dominion, and the dominion of a hermit is solitude.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See you not Loch Lomond silvered in the moon?&rsquo; said the jolly
harper man. &lsquo;Nature inspired me to touch my harp, and I love to
play when the inspiration of Nature comes upon me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The answer pleased the hermit as much as the music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why is your music so sad, my good harper man; what is
there that you would have that fortune denies?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the jolly harper man, &lsquo;I am very poor. My harpings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
all die in the air, and leave me but a scanty purse, poor clothing, and
no roof over my head. You are a man of wisdom, to whom all
things are clear. Point out to me the way to fortune, my wise hermit.
I have a good liberal heart; you could not do a service to a more
deserving man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old hermit sat down on a stone in silence, resting his chin on
his staff. He seemed lost in profound thought. At last he looked up,
and said slowly, pausing between each sentence,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Beyond the border there is a famous country; in that country
there is a palace; near the palace there is a stable, and in that stable
there is a stately horse. That horse is the pride of the kingdom; the
man who would get possession of that horse, without the king&rsquo;s knowledge,
might exchange him for a province.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wonderful! wonderful! But&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Near Striveling town there is a hill; on the hillside is a lot; in
the lot is a fine gray mare, and beside the gray mare is a foal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes! wonderful! but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must now reveal to you one of the secrets of Nature. Separate
that mare from the foal, though it be for hundreds of miles, and, as
soon as she is free, she will return to her foal again. Nature has taught
her how, just as she teaches the birds of passage the way to sunny
islands; or the dog to find the lost hunter; or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, yes; all very wonderful, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In your hand you carry a harp; in the harp lies the power to
make merry; a merry king makes a festive board, and festivity produces
deep sleep in the morning hours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man saw it all in a twinkling; the way to fortune
lay before him clear as sunlight. Perhaps you, Tommy, do not get the
idea so suddenly. If not, I fear you are not gifted like the good
hermit with clearness of vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man returned to Striveling the next day, after
spending the night with the hermit on the borders of Loch Lomond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
&ldquo;The following night he was summoned to play before two famous
Scottish knights, Sir Charles and Sir Roger. They were very valiant,
very rich, and, when put into good humor, were very liberal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man played merrily. The great hall of the castle
seemed full of larks, nightingales, elves, and fairies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, man,&rsquo; said Sir Roger to Sir Charles, in a mellow mood,
&lsquo;you and I could no more harp like that than we could gallop out of
Carlisle on the horse of the king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me make a prophecy,&rsquo; said the jolly harper man at this. &lsquo;I
will one day ride <em>into</em> Carlisle on the horse of the king, and will exchange
the horse for an estate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I will add to the estate five ploughs of land,&rsquo; said Sir Roger;
&lsquo;so that you never shall lack for a home in old Scotland.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And I will add to the five ploughs of land five thousand pounds,&rsquo;
said Sir Charles; &lsquo;so that you never shall lack for good cheer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning the jolly harper man was seen riding out of
Striveling town on a fine gray mare; but a little colt was heard
whinnying alone in the high fenced lot on the side of the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had been a day of high festival at Carlisle; it was now the cool
of the summer eve; the horn of the returning hunter was heard in the
forest, and gaily plumed knights and courtiers were seen approaching
the illuminated palace, urging their steeds along the banks of the
river Eden, that wound through the moonlit landscape like a ribbon
of silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The feast was at its height. The king&rsquo;s heart was merry. There
only needed some novelty, now that the old diversions had come to an
end, to complete the delights of the festive hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly sweet sounds, as of a tuning harp, were heard without
the palace. Then music of marvellous sweetness seemed to fill the
air. The windows and doors of the palace were thrown open. The
king himself left the table, and stood listening on the balcony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A merry tune followed the airy prelude; it made the nerves of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
old nobles tingle as though they were young again; and, as for the
king, his heart began to dance within him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come in! come in, my harper man!&rsquo; shouted the king, shaking
his sides with laughter, and patting a fat noble on the shoulder with
delight. &lsquo;Come in, and let us hear some more of your harping.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man bowed very low. &lsquo;I shall be glad to serve
your grace; but first, give me stabling for my good gray mare.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take the animal to my best stables,&rsquo; said the king. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis there
I keep my Brownie, the finest horse in all the land.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man, accompanied by a gay groom, then took
his horse to the stables; and, as soon as he came out of the stable-door,
struck up his most lively and bewitching tune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grooms all followed him, and the guards followed the grooms.
The servants all came flocking into the hall as the jolly harper man
entered, and the king&rsquo;s heart grew so merry, that all who came were
made welcome, and given good cheer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The small hours of night came at last, and the grand people in the
hall began to yawn, one after another. The jolly harper man now
played a very soothing melody. The king began to yawn, opening
his mouth each time a little wider than before, and finally he dozed off
in his chair, his head tilted back, and his mouth stretched almost from
ear to ear. The fat nobles, too, began to snore. First the king
snored, and then the nobles, which was a very proper way of doing
the thing,&mdash;the blissful sound passing from nose to nose, and making
a circuit of the tables.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guards, grooms, and servants began to feel very comfortable,
indeed; and, though it was their business to keep awake, their eyelids
grew very heavy, and they began to reason that it would be perfectly
safe to doze while their masters were sleeping. Who ever knew any
mischief to happen when everybody was asleep?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jolly harper man now played his dreamiest music, and just
as the cock crew for the first time in the morning, he had the satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
of seeing the last lackey fall asleep. He then blew out the lights,
and crept nimbly forth to the stables. He found the stable door unlocked,
and the gray mare kicking impatiently about, and whinnying
for her foal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you suppose the jolly harper man did? Guess, if
you have Clearness of Vision. He took from his pocket a stout string,
and tied the halter of the king&rsquo;s horse, the finest in all the land, to the
halter of his own animal, and patting the fine gray mare on her side
said: &lsquo;And now go home to your foal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning all was consternation in the palace. The king&rsquo;s
horse was gone. The king sent for the jolly harper man, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My horse has escaped out of the stables, the finest animal in all
the land!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And where is my fine gray mare?&rsquo; asked the jolly harper man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gone, too,&rsquo; said the king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will tell you what I think,&rsquo; said the jolly harper man, with
wonderful confidence. &lsquo;I think that there has been a rogue in the
town.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king, with equal wisdom, favored the idea, and the jolly
harper man made an early escape that morning from the palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the jolly harper man went as fast as he could to Striveling.
Of course, he found his fine gray mare in the lot with her foal, and the
king&rsquo;s horse tied to her halter; and, of course, he rode the noble animal
into Carlisle; and presenting himself before the two knights, Sir
Roger and Sir Charles, claimed his five ploughs of land and five
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go to! go to!&rsquo; said Sir Roger, pointing at him in derision; and
Sir Charles laughed a mighty laugh of scorn. &lsquo;The man does not live
who could ride away the king&rsquo;s Brownie! Go to!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The king&rsquo;s Brownie stands in your own court!&rsquo; cried the jolly
harper man; and Sir Roger and Sir Charles paid their forfeits without
another word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then the jolly harper man returned the king&rsquo;s horse to the royal
owner: and who ever heard of such a thing as a king breaking his
promise? Not the jolly harper man, you may be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the story a true one?&rdquo; asked Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story, as I heard it, was acknowledged to be considerably embellished;
and I have tried to make it as attractive as possible. You
should always remember this, that a good historic story gathers color
by time. The stories of Faust, Macbeth, King Lear, William Tell,
Robert the Devil, and many others I might name, have but meagre
facts for a starting point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a story of Nottingham, that I think as funny as that,&rdquo; said
Tommy. &ldquo;It is about the Wise Men of Gotham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will hear it when we go to Nottingham,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.
&ldquo;I think we will go there at once, after an excursion to the English
Lakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning George Howe and Leander Towle left the
party for Birmingham, London, and Paris, as their means would not
admit of their making easy zigzag journeys through England, in the
way that Master Lewis had planned for the other boys. They agreed
to meet Master Lewis and their companions in London, on their
return from Paris, at which time they would have completed their
tour, and would be obliged to leave for home before the others made
their journey through Normandy.</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn, as we have said, was very fond of old English and
Scottish ballads, and he never lost any good opportunity to hear a
new song.</p>

<p>While the party were talking over their plans for visiting English
places, the sound of a piano in an adjoining room fell upon Ernest&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>He left his companions, and, going into the open room from which
the music came, listened attentively to the playing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you sing?&rdquo; asked Ernest of the player, who was a pleasant-faced
little miss about ten or twelve years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like music. Will you not sing for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can. What would you have me sing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, something about Carlisle: something that I would not hear
at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In America! What, so far? Perhaps you would like to hear
&lsquo;Mona&rsquo;s Waters?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ernest.</p>

<p>The song was very winningly sung.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now perhaps you would like to hear &lsquo;When first I came to merry
Carlisle&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ernest smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean you at all. It was a girl who lost her lover in one
of the Border Wars.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;When first I came to merry Carlisle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ne&rsquo;er was a town sae sweetly seeming:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white rose flaunted o&rsquo;er the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The thistled banners far were streaming.<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;When next I came to merry Carlisle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh sad, sad, seemed the town, an&rsquo; eerie!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The auld, auld men came out and wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O maiden! come ye to seek yere dearie?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that song,&rdquo; said Ernest. &ldquo;I have heard &lsquo;Highland
Mary&rsquo; sung at Ayr, and shall always remember it. And I shall
also be pleased to recollect,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;When first I came to merry Carlisle.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;And &lsquo;the girl I left behind me,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Tommy Toby to Ernest,
softly.</p>

<p>The Miss saw the point of the joke, and, as it was politely spoken,
received the implied compliment with becoming modesty and good-humor,
saying that she should also remember very pleasantly the visit
of the Zigzag Club to her father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Sherwood Forest.&mdash;Nottingham.&mdash;Story of the Wise Men of Gotham.</p>
</div>


<p><span class="dch01"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>AVE stood by the graves of Wordsworth and Coleridge.
The trees were green and cool; the Rotha rippled
beside the poets&rsquo; resting-place, and Helvellyn and Catchedicam
in the distance rose in the calm, bright air.
Beautiful indeed are these mountains in midsummer. The whole
Lake region is beautiful&mdash;beautiful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the brief entry Wyllys Wynn made in the journal in his
guide-book, on returning from the English Lakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a touching story associated with Helvellyn,&rdquo; said Wyllys
to Master Lewis, as the boys were returning from the Lakes, &ldquo;that
Scott has told in very musical verse. It is of a little dog that watched
beside the dead body of his master for several months, and was found
guarding the bones. Will you not relate it to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wordsworth and Scott, I think,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;both tell
the story in verse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the year 1805 there dwelt in the district a young man of
elegant tastes, who loved to explore these mountain regions. He was
well known for his literary attainments, and greatly beloved for his
gentle and amiable manners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He used to make frequent excursions among the wild mountains,
and would spend whole days feasting his eye on the exhaustless beauties
they afforded. He was always attended by a little terrier dog, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
which he was greatly attached, and which was ever on the alert to do
his master&rsquo;s bidding. Scott, in his ballad, calls the young man the
Wanderer, and so I will call him now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One spring day, when the streams were swollen, and the mountains
were all alive with waterfalls, birds, and flowers, the Wanderer
set out on an excursion that promised unusual attractions, attended by
his little favorite. He penetrated too far, or remained too long; night
probably overtook him, and he lost his way. He fell from a precipice,
and was dashed in pieces. For several months the little dog
watched by the remains of his beloved master, only leaving them, it is
supposed, to obtain necessary food. The remains of the Wanderer
were found during the following summer by a party of excursionists,
and, when discovered, the terrier was guarding them with pitying
care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Walter Scott, in company with Wordsworth, ascended Helvellyn
during the following autumn, and visited the spot where the Wanderer
died. The well-known ballad, one of the most pathetic of Scott&rsquo;s
poetical compositions, was the result of this excursion.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;I climbed the dark brow of the mighty Helvellyn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lakes and mountains beneath me gleamed misty and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was still, save by fits, when the eagle was yelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And starting around me the echoes replied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the right Striden-edge round the Red-tarn was bending,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Catchedicam its left verge was defending,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One huge, nameless rock in the front was ascending,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When I marked the sad spot where the Wanderer had died.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Class stopped at Sheffield, and thence began their first experience
of English stage-coaching to the old town of Mansfield. They
entered the latter upon a market-day, and found the streets full of
empty carts, cattle, and rustic people, presenting a scene of truly ancient
simplicity. Mansfield is still a miller&rsquo;s town, and must present
nearly the same appearance as in the days of Henry II., who, according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
to the old ballad, was lost in the forests near the place. The forests,
however, have changed: little remains of them but a heath, traversed
by wild and romantic roads. Here and there a great tree, like a forest
lord, may be seen, to remind one of the kingly hunting days.</p>

<p>Leaving Mansfield for Sherwood Forest, strange houses by the
wayside, excavated in limestone and recalling the supposed age of
the cave-dwellers, as in an unexpected picture, much excited the boys&rsquo;
curiosity.</p>

<p>Sherwood Forest, or as much of it as remains, is twenty-five miles
long and about eight broad. The new growth of trees is very fine;
but it is the remains of the
grand old oaks that attract the
tourist and summer wanderer.
The wood has a ground-work
of exhaustless ferns, the delicate
birches flutter in the warm
winds, their peculiar shade contrasting
with the greenery around
them. Here and there oaks of
different ages and altitudes rise
gray, gnarled, and almost leafless,&mdash;oaks
on which a thousand
tempests have beaten, and around
which ten thousand storms have
blown. In Henry II.&rsquo;s time
not only Nottingham, but the
whole of England, was covered
with oaks.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">SHAMBLE OAK.</p>

<p>Tommy Toby was very urgent
to visit some of the old
historic oaks of Sherwood, especially such as are associated with
quaint stories and tragic histories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
Procuring a guide, the Class went first to see Shamble Oak. Think
of it: in the main circuit it is thirty-four feet! It is called Shamble
Oak because a butcher once
used its hollow trunk to conceal
stolen sheep. He was
hung on an oak.</p>

<p>The guide next took the
boys to a dreamy old place
called Welbeck Park, to see
the Greendale Oak, supposed
to be seven hundred years old,
and which has a circumference
of more than thirty-five feet!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as though it had
the rheumatism,&rdquo; said Tommy.
&ldquo;With all of its crutches and
canes it will not live many
years longer. Do you think it
will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it likely to outlive
all of us,&rdquo; said the guide.
&ldquo;More than one hundred and
fifty years ago an arch was
cut in this tree, and a lord
rode through it on his wedding
day. It was very, very
old then; but the lord is gone,
and the oak lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">GREENDALE OAK.</p>

<p>The guide procured for the party a vehicle, and drove to Parliament
Oak, under which it is said that Edward I. held a Parliament
in 1290. The tree still furnishes green boughs. Its girth is about
twenty-nine feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
Newstead Abbey, the home of Lord Byron, forms a part of the
old forest of Sherwood, and is but a short distance from Mansfield.
It was founded by Henry II.,
and presents one of the picturesque
and interesting ruins
in this part of England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not be allowed
to visit the Abbey,&rdquo; said the
guide. &ldquo;The rooms of Lord
Byron remain just as he left
them; his bedstead, with gilded
coronets, his pictures, portraits
of friends, writing-table, and
all; but it is private property,
and visitors are not allowed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Abbey was built by
Henry as one of the many
peace offerings which he made
for the murder of Thomas &agrave;
Becket,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.
&ldquo;You remember the story?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 273px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">PARLIAMENT OAK.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn.
&ldquo;Thomas &agrave; Becket claimed
that the power of the clergy was superior to the power of the king,
and Henry pronounced him a traitor. He was killed at the altar by
a party of conspirators, whose deed had the supposed sanction of
the king. Henry did penance at Thomas &agrave; Becket&rsquo;s tomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stripped his back, and allowed the monks to whip him, did he
not?&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I remember the picture of it in my history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Distant views of Newstead, so full of strange memories and fantastic
histories, were all the Class could obtain. The ruin looked down
upon the charming old Nottinghamshire woodlands like a picture of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
the past, and the spirit of romance and poetry seemed to linger around
it still.</p>

<p class="caption">MORTIMER&rsquo;S HOLE.</p>

<p>Going next to the fine old town of Nottingham, almost the first
thing which the boys desired to see was Mortimer&rsquo;s Hole. This is a
passage through a sand-rock, more than three hundred feet in length.
Through this passage young Edward entered Nottingham Castle by
night, and thus surprised and captured Mortimer (Earl of March).
The wicked Earl was conveyed by the same passage out of the castle
so secretly that the guards were not aware that it had been entered.</p>

<p>In the evening spent at Nottingham, Tommy Toby was asked
about his story of which he had spoken in connection with the place.</p>

&ldquo;It is not a story of Nottingham, but of Gotham, near Nottingham.
It is about the Wise Men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who went to sea in a bowl?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they were much wiser than that. I will try to tell it in the
way Master Lewis tells his stories: in the rather <em>decorated</em> style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will always have as nice a sense of honor as you show
now,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;whenever you make the slightest change
from plain truth to parable. You have a tact for story-telling, for one
so young; and you studied up the story of &lsquo;The Frolicsome Duke,&rsquo;
which you told the Club, in a manner that quite surprised us. I hope
this story will prove as entertaining.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF THE WISE MEN OF GOTHAM.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;More than six hundred and fifty years ago, there reigned in
England a king, named John. They called him <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sansterre</i> or Lackland,
for, unlike his brothers, he had received from his father no fiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the son of Henry Plantagenet, a good king, as kings went
in those rude times, who governed England for thirty-four years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother was Eleanora of Aquitaine, who was, in her day, the
prettiest girl in France. But she was a wilful little woman and full of
craft. She married the French king first, but, not liking him on account
of his monkish ways, she procured a divorce, and told Henry
Plantagenet, who was young and handsome and gay, that she would
like to marry him. He accepted the proposal, because the union
would add to his dominions several provinces. Henry loved Rosamond
Clifford,&mdash;&lsquo;Fair Rosamond,&rsquo;&mdash;whom he had met in the valley
of the Wye, and who was the prettiest girl in all the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage proved an unhappy one. Henry soon discovered
what a wily, wilful little woman she was; he tried to curb her, and a
terrible time he had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Richard succeeded his father. It was he who made the grandest
crusade of the Middle Ages; who was married at Cyprus in flower-time;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
who fought with noble Saladin at Acre and Jaffa; who was
obliged to sail away from the Holy Land; who looked back from his
beautiful ship on the unconquered coast with regret; who was shipwrecked
and cast upon a hostile coast; and who was discovered, when
imprisoned in a gloomy old castle on the Danube, by the harp of
Blondel the Troubadour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then came John, in whose veins flowed the worst blood of King
Henry&rsquo;s family. Prince Arthur, Geoffrey&rsquo;s son, had the best claim to the
crown, but somehow John got himself crowned, and he began to reign
so terribly that the hearts of the barons quaked within them; and so, for
a time, he silenced all opposition. He was as cunning as bad Queen
Eleanora, and he loved to make mischief as well. He would order
that a man should be killed, apparently with as little conscience as he
would have ordered a butcher to slay a sheep. Most bad kings have
been notable for some good qualities; King John, so far as I know,
had none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Nottinghamshire there is an old town, removed from the great
centres of life and activity, called Gotham. The inhabitants were of
good Saxon stock, and they hated the whole race of Norman Plantagenets.
These people had learned something of liberty from bold
Robin Hood, &lsquo;all under the greenwood tree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day there came a report to Old Gotham that King John was
making a progress, and would pass through the town. Now it was an
old custom in feudal times that the course that a king took, in passing
for the first time through a district or a shire, should become ever after
a public highway. The people of Gotham wanted no public highway
to their town, no avenue that would open their retreat to the Normans,
and put them more easily in the power of brutal kings. And they
hated John. So they held a council, and resolved that the feet of John
Lackland, the murderer, should never dishonor the town of Gotham.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">RICHARD&rsquo;S FAREWELL TO THE HOLY LAND.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the people understood that it would be a foolhardy work to
oppose the progress of the king openly. They must rely upon their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"><!-- original location of 'Richard's farewell to the Holy Land' --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
wits. The men decided to go in a body and fell large trees across a
certain upland, over which the royal party must pass to enter the town.
This they did, making a barrier through which mounted horsemen
would find it difficult to break, and which would compel a party like
the king&rsquo;s to turn off by another way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When King John came to the eminence, and found his progress
arrested, he was very angry, and, finding a couple of rustics near the
place, he demanded of them who had made the barrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The people of Gotham,&rsquo; answered one of the rustics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go you to Gotham,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;and tell the people from me,
that as soon as I return to camp I will send a troop to cut off their
noses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two rustics ran off, terribly frightened, and reported the
cheerful intelligence at Gotham. Oh, then there were stirring times
in that old town! The people had no wish to receive a kingly decoration
in that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was to be done?</p>

<p>&ldquo;They met for consultation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there were wise men in Gotham, and, when the convention
met, these wise men expressed their opinions not only on the nose
question, but on public affairs in general. After a long deliberation,
one of these wise men, whom I will call Fitz Peter, said: &lsquo;Our wits
have thus far prevented King John from setting foot in our town, and
our wits are able to save our noses.&rsquo; This opinion was received with
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how should they accomplish the end?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now chief among the wise men of Gotham was one whom I will
call Leofric. He at last stood up with a very knowing look, and said:
&lsquo;I have heard of many people who were punished for being wise, but
I never heard of a person who was punished for being a fool. When
the king&rsquo;s troops come, let us each imitate a safe example, and act like
a fool.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
&ldquo;At this the people shouted. So they decided to rely on their wits
for the safety of their noses, and to act like fools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One morning, very early, as a party of horsemen were leaving
the town for hunting, a troop appeared, with a fierce sheriff at their
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bowmen were terribly scared, and the question passed around
as to what they should do. They hit upon a plan, and threw away
their hunting-gear. When the sheriff came up, he found the old men
rolling great stones up the hill, and the young men bending over
and grunting as if they were in great distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; demanded the sheriff of one of the old
men who was tugging away at a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We are rolling stones up hill for day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You old fool!&rsquo; said the sheriff. &lsquo;Go home and go to bed, and
day will come itself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; returned the man, as though greatly astonished, &lsquo;I never
thought of that. How wise you be! You are the wisest man I ever
did see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what are <em>you</em> doing?&rsquo; asked the sheriff, of one of the
young men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We do the <em>grunting</em>,&rsquo; was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old men do the lifting, and the young men do the grunting!&rsquo;
exclaimed the sheriff. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he added, in sudden good-humor,
&lsquo;that is the way the world goes everywhere!&rsquo; And he galloped away,
leaving the men unharmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheriff next met four old women, with brooms on their
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whither away?&rsquo; asked the sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the priest&rsquo;s, to be married,&rsquo; said they all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the priest&rsquo;s, to be married?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We go every morning to be married,&rsquo; answered one of the old
crones, &lsquo;and we have been for the last forty years!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then why are you not married?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The priest says that we do not bring the right thing. We carry
something new every morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But why do you not take a <em>man</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">A man!</span>&rsquo; exclaimed the old woman, leaping straight into the air.
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">A man?</span> I never thought of that! How wise you be! Why, you
are the wisest man that I ever did see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheriff next met some men who had started on a journey,
each of whom carried on his back a door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you carry that door?&rsquo; asked the sheriff of one of the
travellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Left my money at home.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Then why not leave the door at home too?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Afraid of thieves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Afraid of thieves? Then leave your door at home to protect
your money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They can&rsquo;t break in, because, you see, I&rsquo;ve got the door.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave your door at home, and take your money with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never thought of that. How wise you be! You are the wisest
man that I ever did see!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sheriff let the travellers pass on unmolested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The people are all fools here,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It would be too bad to harm such simple people,&rsquo; said his comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fools all,&rsquo; said the sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fools all,&rsquo; said the horsemen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us go back,&rsquo; said the sheriff, &lsquo;and report to the king that the
people in Gotham are fools.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; said the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they returned to the king, and reported that Gotham was a
place of fools. And from these circumstances, or incidents like these,
if I may believe an old tale, the men of that place were called, in derision,
&lsquo;The Wise Men of Gotham,&rsquo; from that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dcm01"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>ASTER LEWIS gave the boys a couple of days in Nottingham
to enjoy themselves as they liked.</p>

<p>Tommy Toby went <em>hunting</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to be able to tell people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
have hunted in Sherwood Forest, the royal hunting-ground of English
kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In midsummer?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis. &ldquo;I fancy if you were to
use a gun in the Forest of Sherwood, you might make a longer vacation
abroad than you intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not intend to use a gun. I have bought me a bow and
some arrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see them,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;They look very harmless,
certainly.&rdquo; Master Lewis seemed to hesitate about making further
objections.</p>

<p>Just what came of Tommy&rsquo;s hunting we cannot state at this stage
of our narrative. He left the boys at the hotel, bow and arrows in
hand, and saying as a word of parting,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the wood, said Richard to Robin.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
He evidently went outside of the city into the wooded district, that
was a part of old Sherwood Forest. When Master Lewis found that
he had really gone out of the place he looked troubled, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have prevented it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy returned late on the evening of the same day after a
ten hours&rsquo; absence. He certainly looked like a modern hunter, for
he was empty handed, and his clothes were in a very disarranged condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are your bow and arrows?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall tell you nothing at all about it, now,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;It is
my own secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have two secrets,&rdquo; said Frank, referring to the fact that
Tommy had been made custodian of the secret he was supposed to
have selected for the Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but <em>that</em> don&rsquo;t <em>amount to much</em>,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nothing, after all</em>,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, quietly, who had seen
Tommy&rsquo;s conundrum on a card. &ldquo;I did not suppose that you really
intended to spend the day in the country alone with bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just look at my legs,&rdquo; said Tommy, rolling up his pants, and
showing bloody scars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get <em>them</em>?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Up a tree.</em> Please do not ask me now. If you will excuse
me from telling you now, I will give you a full account some other
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will excuse you from giving an account of yourself, to-night; but
please remember that you must not go hunting, or anywhere, alone
again without my permission,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, noticing some singular
rents in Tommy&rsquo;s clothes.</p>

<p>Tommy went to his supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been chased by the <em>terriblest</em> bull you ever saw,&rdquo; he whispered
confidentially to Wyllys Wynn, as he passed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all
about it some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
He added,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that ain&rsquo;t all. I&rsquo;ve been chased by <em>John</em> Bull, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">PEVERIL OF THE PEAK.</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn went, under an arrangement made for him by Master
Lewis, to the Peak near Castleton, wishing to view the scene of Sir
Walter Scott&rsquo;s charming romance, &ldquo;Peveril of the Peak.&rdquo; He found
there only a pitiful ruin, and instead of knights with dancing plumes
and silver shields, with which fancy pictures the eyry of the grand
old Norman baron, he met some very strange-looking mining people,
who are often to be seen in the rural districts in this part of
England.</p>

<p>One incident touched Frank&rsquo;s kind heart, and seemed more to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
impress him than the associations of manorial splendor he had made
the journey to see.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE BOY AT THE WHEEL.</p>

<p>In the entrance of one of the caves of the Peak was a little
rope-spinner, who was lame, and whose time was spent from sun to
sun in turning the wheel,&mdash;always the same, faithfully turning the
wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave him a shilling,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;spoke kindly to him, and left
him gazing after me with tears in his eyes, still turning his wheel,
turning his wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Nottingham Master Lewis and the boys went to Birmingham,
and Frank Gray and Ernest Wynn made a d&eacute;tour to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
little village of Madeley, and
visited Boscobel, the place of
refuge of King Charles II. after
his defeat at the battle of
Worcester. The king first arrived
at White Ladies about
three-quarters of a mile from
Boscobel House: there he secreted
himself in an oak, afterwards
famous as the Royal
Oak of Boscobel. The brothers
Penderell, foresters and
yeomen, concealed him in closets in their simple mansion, being
true to their sovereign at the risk of their lives, when it might have
raised them from poverty to riches to have uttered a treacherous
word.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">BOSCOBEL.</p>

<p>The closets in which Charles was concealed are exhibited to visitors,
and Frank and Ernest were allowed to pass up and down the passages
that had afforded so secure a retreat to the fugitive. In the parlor
they were shown a
chimney-piece, and
on one of the panels
a picture of the king
in the oak, and on
another the king in
disguise on horse-back,
escorted by the
Penderells.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 383px;">

<img src="images/zje055.jpg" width="383" height="250"

</div>

<p>It is said that the
king&rsquo;s pursuers were
thrown off the right
track of discovery by an owl that flew out of the oak where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
concealed, leading the captain to say, &ldquo;The owl loveth not company, and
where he is no one else can
be.&rdquo; It is also related that when
Charles complained of the slowness
of the horse on which he
fled in disguise, one of the Penderells
remarked that the animal
never before had &ldquo;the
weight of three kingdoms on
his back.&rdquo; These stories may
not be quite true, but one is
reminded of them by the figures
on the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>The Class next went to
Leamington, a most convenient
point from which to make short
excursions to Stratford-on-Avon,
Warwick Castle, and
Kenilworth Castle. Leamington,
although itself not historically
interesting, is provided
with excellent hotels, being an English watering-place.</p>

<p class="caption">KING CHARLES&rsquo;S HIDING PLACE.</p>

<p>The first excursion of the party from Leamington was to Stratford-on-Avon,
to the house where Shakspeare was born, and the church in
which he was buried.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 471px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">SHAKSPEARE.</p>

<p>The birthplace of Shakspeare is an antique-looking stone house two
stones high, with picturesque gables fronting the street. In the room
where he first saw the light of the world he was to enrich with his
thought there is a cast of his face taken after his death, and a portrait
painted in the prime of his life. The latter showed a truly noble
brow; it was such a face as fancy itself might paint, so royally did it
seem endowed with genius. In this room Sir Walter Scott had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"><!-- original location of 'Shakspeare' --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
inscribed his name on a pane of glass, and Wordsworth once wrote a
stanza which is still preserved under glass. It began with these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The house of Shakspeare&rsquo;s birth we here may see;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That of his death we find without a trace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain the inquiry, for immortal he&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the poet seemed to pause as though the literary work was not
satisfactory; he drew his pen across what he had written, and under it
wrote the following stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Of mighty Shakspeare&rsquo;s birth the room we see;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That where he died, in vain to find we try.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Useless the search, for, all immortal he:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And those who are immortal never die.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The effort furnishes a curious illustration of the methods of a
poet&rsquo;s mind in careful composition.</p>

<p>Back of the house is a garden, in which grew the old English
flowers that are portrayed by the poet in his dramas.</p>

<p>From the house the party went to the cottage of Anne Hathaway,
Shakspeare&rsquo;s wife, whom he loved in youth when life&rsquo;s bright ways lay
fair before him. It is a house which is mainly noticeable for its simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the place where he sat when he came to see his sweetheart,&rdquo;
said the old lady who showed the house.</p>

<p>Shakspeare and his wife sleep in the same beautiful church amid
the bowery town of Stratford-on-Avon; and thither, rowing up the
Avon almost to the churchyard, our tourists made their way.</p>

<p>The party approached the church through an avenue of limes, and
entered the richly-carved oak doors of the Gothic porch. The tomb
of Shakspeare is in the chancel. The Avon runs but a short distance
from the walls, and the cool boughs of the summer trees wave before
the windows. A flat stone marks the place where the poet is buried,
on which are inscribed the oft quoted lines said to be written by the
poet himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Good friend, for Jesus&rsquo; sake forbear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dig the dust enclosed here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest be the spade that spares these stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curst be he that moves my bones.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Over the grave, in a niche of the wall, is a bust of the poet. The
inscription mentions his age as fifty-three years.</p>

<p class="caption">ANNE HATHAWAY&rsquo;S COTTAGE.</p>

<p>Returning to the birthplace, Frank Gray and Tommy Toby visited
the Shakspeare Museum. The collection of curiosities was somewhat
comical,&mdash;such for example as a phial containing <em>juice</em> from mulberries
gathered from Shakspeare&rsquo;s mulberry-tree; Shakspeare&rsquo;s jug,
from which Garrick sipped wine at the Jubilee in 1769. Frank seemed
to enjoy the specimens, his mind poetically associating them with bygone
scenes.</p>

Tommy showed a great contempt for Frank&rsquo;s wonder-talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found something now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that outdoes all the rest.
It is a letter written&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Shakspeare?&rdquo; asked Frank, in an animated way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: <em>to</em> Shakspeare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Richard Quyney. You have often heard of him, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was probably a literary man,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably. He asked for a <em>loan</em> of thirty pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day&rsquo;s trip was to Kenilworth Castle, an ivy-hung ruin
associated with the whole of England&rsquo;s history, and traditionally with
the romances of King Arthur. The walls are broken, the great
banqueting hall has just fallen into decay, and where the coronals
flashed and astrals blazed at night, now shine only the dim light of the
moon and stars. Here Queen Elizabeth was entertained by her favorite,
the Earl of Leicester. The splendor of that reception has rarely been
equalled. The f&ecirc;te, which was one long banquet, broken by a most wonderful
series of dramatic representations, lasted seventeen days. There
were tilts and tournaments; the park was peopled with gods and goddesses
to surprise the Queen wherever she went; nymphs and mermaids
rose from the pools, and there was minstrelsy on every hand. Thirty-one
barons were present. Ten oxen were slaughtered every morning,
sixteen hogsheads of wine and forty hogsheads of beer were consumed
daily. There were lodged in the castle four hundred servants, all of
whom appeared in new liveries of velvet, and shared the unrestrained
hospitality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the clocks in the castle were stopped during that long festival,&rdquo;
said Master Lewis, &ldquo;and the hands were all left pointing at the banquet
hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But time went on,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, time went on, and the maiden Queen grew old as all mortals
must, and there came a time when her vanity could no longer be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
deceived. She sought to keep from sight the white hairs and wrinkles
of age by every art, but Nature did its work, as with Canute and the
sea. When her form and features began to lose whatever of beauty
they once possessed, she tried to banish from her mind the reality that
she was past her prime by viewing herself in false and flattering
mirrors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the wrinkles grew deeper, and the white hairs multiplied, and
her limbs lost their power, and her strength at last was gone. Her
flatterers still fed her fondness for admiration with their arts, and while
life offered her any prospect she still smiled upon those whom she
must have suspected were deceiving her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One day,&rsquo; says her attendant, Lady Southwell, &lsquo;she desired to
see a <em>true glass</em>, which in twenty years before she had not seen, but
only such an one as on purpose was made to deceive her sight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They brought it to the poor withered Queen. She raised it to
her face with her bony hands, and looked. For the first time for years
she saw herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a revelation. Her old rage came back again. She pointed
to her flatterers with scorn, and ordered them to quit her presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then came the Archbishop of Canterbury, disgracing his sacred
office by his words. &lsquo;Madam,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;your piety, your zeal, and the
admirable work of the Reformation afford great grounds of confidence
for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the wretchedly disenchanted woman could no longer be deceived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the crown that I have borne so long has
given me enough of <em>vanity</em> in my time. I beseech you not to augment
it at this hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had seen herself, and the world also, in the true glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn was observed by Master Lewis making a collection
of ivy leaves at Kenilworth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you collect leaves at all the historic places you visit?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span></p>

&ldquo;I picked some heather at the birthplace of Burns, brought ivy from
Melrose, and wild flowers from Newstead and from the Peak, and I
purchased flowers from Shakspeare&rsquo;s garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you privately. George Howe is pleased with collections
of interesting things,&mdash;shells, stamps, autographs. He has but
little money, and I am making a scrap-book of pictures, leaves, and
flowers collected at notable places, as a present for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me an admirable plan,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;I
should be pleased with such a book myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the party visited Warwick Castle, one of the finest
and best preserved of all the ancient country seats of the English
nobility. To one approaching it, its rich lawns, its towering trees (of
which some are from Lebanon), its picturesque windows, and harmony
of design make it an ideal of castellated beauty.</p>

<p>The Class was ceremoniously admitted by men in livery, and was
taken charge of by a portly and pompous Englishwoman, who wore
a black silk that rustled as she swept along. She carried a bunch of
keys at her side, and evidently entertained a high sense of the dignity
of her position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>This</em>,&rdquo; said the stately lady, pointing to an immense structure of
armor, &ldquo;this is the armor of the mighty Guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mighty Guy!&rdquo; said Tommy Toby, with large eyes, &ldquo;will you
please tell us who <em>he</em> was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The antique portress stared as though amazed at such a confession
of ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are from America,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>

<p>Master Lewis smiled at being included in the uninstructed &ldquo;we.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guy was a giant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy&rsquo;s interest grew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was the great Earl of Warwick: a valiant soldier who slew
so many people that he became melancholy, and retired to Guy&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
Cliff, as it is now called, and there lived alone in a cave for thirty
years. He was <em>nine</em> feet high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is <em>that</em>?&rdquo; said Tommy Toby, pointing to an immense
pot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the antique lady, &ldquo;was the mighty Guy&rsquo;s <em>porridge pot</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much does it hold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It holds one hundred and twenty gallons, and weighs eight hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the mighty Guy drink as much porridge as that at every
meal?&rdquo; asked Tommy, his curiosity taking a wider circle with each
new statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; all of these things happened long, long before I
was born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em>,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;is a rib of the Dun Cow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a cow was that?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a cow which the mighty Guy killed on Dunsmore Heath.
It weighs nine pounds and a half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the rib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady led the party in a procession which she dramatically
headed through the lower rooms of the principal building. She
showed them the superb old baronial hall; the drawing-rooms, magnificent
with tapestries and inlaid furniture; the pictures by Vandyke.
Then in an awesome manner she suddenly stopped, and said in a low
confidential voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Countess herself is above stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many feet high is the Countess? I&rsquo;d give a quarter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy&rsquo;s intended remark was checked by Master Lewis.</p>

<p>The lady requested a fee on showing the party back to the lodge,
and dismissed Master Lewis with a stiff bow that indicated a want of
confidence in American respect for the great and mighty Guy and his
successors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indeed a city of institutions,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very old city, is it not?&rdquo; asked Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said to have been the residence of Alfred the Great, and of
King Canute. The University of Oxford was, according to tradition,
founded by Alfred the Great.&rdquo;</p>

although he was a mere

<p>&ldquo;This was the king,&rdquo;
said Tommy Toby, &ldquo;who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
when flying from the Danes in disguise, was left by a rustic&rsquo;s wife to
watch some cakes that were baking by the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let them burn,&rdquo; said Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The woman,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;gave him a gentle hint, saying that
if he was too lazy to watch them, he would be glad enough to eat
them when they were cooked. I have heard my mother make very
similar remarks.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">CANUTE AND HIS COURTIERS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Canute, of whom you spoke, was the king who ordered his throne
to be placed on the margin of the sea,&rdquo; said Wyllys to Master Lewis,
&ldquo;and then commanded the sea to rise no farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
&ldquo;But the sea rose,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;and the king refused to
wear again his golden crown for ever, resolving to serve only that
King who rules the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The history of Oxford
covers a period of a thousand
years,&rdquo; continued Master
Lewis. &ldquo;Here Queen
Matilda, or the Empress
Maud, as she was called,
because she had been the
wife of the German Emperor,
was besieged by King
Stephen, who had usurped
the throne, and thence she
fled from him one snowy
day, herself and attendants
dressed in white that they
might not be discovered;
here the people closed the
gates against William the
Conqueror; here Richard I.
was born, and here Ridley,
Latimer, and Cranmer were
burned. The early history
of nearly all great English scholars for many centuries is associated
with the colleges in this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">FLIGHT OF EMPRESS MAUD.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How green are the English meadows with their hedgerows and
trees!&rdquo; said Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how bright are the streams that run among them! An
English landscape is more rich and varied than an American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never would tell of it,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;Grass is grass, and we
have just as good grass at home as anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
&ldquo;We have no buildings at
home that are quite equal to
Warwick Castle,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better to admit excellences
frankly wherever one
is,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;and
never let any prejudice color
an opinion. When one is travelling
it is well never to make
a comparison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few scenes are more charming,
especially on a long sunny
summer afternoon, than the college
buildings of Oxford, separated
by gardens, meadows, and
rows of venerable trees, the
latter as old as the roofs and
spires that rise above them.</p>

<p class="caption">DEATH OF LATIMER AND RIDLEY.</p>

<p>While at Oxford the boys were taken to Woodstock, a distance
of some eight miles. The old ballad of &ldquo;Fair Rosamond&rdquo; so haunted
the mind of Ernest Wynn, at Oxford, that he induced Master Lewis
to make an excursion to Woodstock, the scene of the fancied
tragedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen Kenilworth, the scene of one of Walter Scott&rsquo;s
romances,&rdquo; said Ernest; &ldquo;have been among the associations of
&lsquo;Ivanhoe,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Peveril of the Peak,&rsquo; and I shall always be glad to
have seen the place of the novelist&rsquo;s other English fiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The town of Woodstock once constituted a part of the royal
demesnes. Here Ethelred held a council, and Alfred the Great translated
the &ldquo;Consolations of Boethius.&rdquo; The history of the old palace
of Woodstock is associated with dark romances, splendid cavalcades,
and crumbled kings and queens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
Not a vestige of the palace now remains; its site is merely marked
by two sycamore trees.</p>

<p>The famous Rosamond&rsquo;s Bower, Maze, or Labyrinth seems to have
consisted of a succession of under-ground
chambers, and is thought to have existed
before the time of King Henry II., who
is supposed to have used it to hide
Fair Rosamond from his jealous queen.
There was but one way into it, though there were many ways that
would lead astray any one who should try to find the right passage.
It may have been like the following diagram, which may puzzle the
reader who attempts to find an open way to the centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 493px;">

</div>

<p>Henry II. had married Eleanor of Aquitaine, a woman of bad
reputation, full of craft and wickedness, whom the French king had
put away. But he gave his affections to Rosamond Clifford, whose
beauty had charmed him when he first met her in the valley of Wye.
It is said that she supposed herself wedded to him; but however this
may be, she and not Eleanor was the spouse of his heart. She pined
away in the seclusion that the king provided for her, but he was true
to her in her illness; he hovered around her sick bed, and at last,
when she was laid away to rest in the chapel at Edstowe Nunnery, he
kept her grave bright with lights and
sweet with flowers. The story of her
being poisoned by Queen Eleanor is
a fiction, although it is said the Queen
discovered her place of concealment,
and administered to her a severe reproof.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of learning dispels
superstition, but history clings
fondly to the fine old legends of the
past that gather around them unreal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
lights and shadows. It is not strange that Oxford, the quiet valley
town, hidden even to the bases of its pinnacles, spires, and towers
in ancient groves, through which glide the waters of the Thames,
should still preserve traditions of the wonder-working gifts of its
early philosophers, whom ignorance associated with the magical arts
and regarded as more than men.</p>

<p>It is related that two old Oxford monks made a head of brass that
spoke.</p>

<p>These wise monks discovered
from their wonderful
books (the like of which
are not now to be found in
any of the twenty colleges)
that if they were able to
make a head of brass that
could speak, and if they
could <em>hear</em> it speak within a
month, they would be given
the power to surround England
with a magic wall of
brass.</p>

<p>So they studied their
folios, and found out the
chemistry of making the
wonderful head.</p>

<p>They listened to hear it
three weeks, and then became irresistibly sleepy. So they intrusted
a servant to listen, and to wake them if the statue should begin to
speak.</p>

<p>When they were well asleep, the head said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
&ldquo;Time was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The servant, not knowing the secret of the monks, failed to awake
them as he had been ordered to do, and down came the figure with a
fearful crash; and England has remained without any other wall of
brass than enters into an Englishman&rsquo;s composition to this day.</p>

writing, and rest.</p>

<p>In the morning, after breakfast, the Class took a walk
to the suburbs, and rested on some wayside seats overlooking
the Thames.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, cool and still. The world of sunlight
all seemed to be above the trees, an over-sea of gold, of which the long
arcades of intermingling boughs afforded but glimpses.</p>

<p>Near the wayside resting-place was a field bordered with trees. A
speck of a bird rose from it out of the grass uttering a few notes that
attracted the boys&rsquo; attention. Up, up it went like a rocket, and as
it rose higher and higher its song became sweeter and sweeter,&mdash;a
happy, trilling melody, which made every boy leap to his feet, and try
to find a place where he could see it through the openings in the
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bird seems to have gone straight up to heaven,&rdquo; said Wyllys
Wynn. &ldquo;I can hardly see it; but I can hear its melody yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an English skylark,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;so famous in

I am glad you have seen it. I wish we might see more of common
sights and scenes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have here a letter from George Howe and Leander Towle,
which greatly pleases me. My object is to take you to historic scenes.
George and Leander have different tastes from yours, and expect to
follow different occupations. They are making their journey a study
of common life and its pursuits, as I would have them do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not read their letter to us?&rdquo; asked Ernest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just what I was about to do,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Caen, Normandy</span>, July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Teacher</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I begin my letter here in this city, which I suppose has an atmosphere of
old history, but which is interesting to me because it is the centre of the &ldquo;food-producing
land&rdquo; of France, as Lower Normandy is well called. All of this part
of the country through which I have passed is a scene of thrift, productiveness,
and plenty. The people are all busy and happy. Occupied minds are always
happy, I believe.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>We rode a part of the way to London on what is called, I think, Parliamentary
trains. This is not a train of grand coaches for the use of members
of Parliament, but a sort of slow-coach train which Parliament has enacted shall
carry cattle, produce, and commercial necessities for a fixed rate a mile. Or
this is the way in which the running of these cheap trains was explained to me.</p>

<p>It would have been a hard ride, had not new scenes been continually coming
into view, and the train have gone so slowly that we were enabled to enjoy them
almost as well as though we had been riding on an English stage-coach. I was
so interested in the new objects that presented themselves that I entirely forgot
the manner of conveyance.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that ride: it was like viewing a long panorama.</p>

<p>It cost me only about &pound;1 or $5.00, to travel from Scotland to London.</p>

<p>We took a lodging room in London which cost us a shilling a night
apiece. While in London I visited the Tower, Westminster Abbey, Windsor,
and the principal Parks. The half day spent in Westminster Abbey was worth
all the discomforts of the journey across the sea.</p>

<p>We also made a journey to Sydenham Crystal Palace,&mdash;an immense museum
of novelties, to which the admission is only one shilling. It is probably the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
palace ever built for the people, and I like the idea of a people&rsquo;s palace better
than a king&rsquo;s. It occupies with its grounds about three hundred acres, and
cost nearly &pound;2,000,000. Twenty-five acres of glass were used in its construction.
The museum is full of the products of industry of all countries and times.
Think of it&mdash;all for one shilling! It is a thing to make one always respect the
English people.</p>

<p>I need say very little of the tombs of the twenty or thirty kings and queens in
Westminster Abbey. I was first impressed with the value of fame when I read
inscriptions to persons once famous of whom I never heard,&mdash;Thomas Shadwell,
Poet Laureate in the Court of William III.; Mrs. Oldfield, whom we are
told was buried &ldquo;in a fine Brussels lace head-dress,&rdquo;&mdash;and I thought, Well, all
men can do is to perform their duty, and time will one day make forgotten
Thomas Shadwells and Mrs. Oldfields of them all.</p>

<p>While in London I made also a pleasant excursion into Berkshire, and there
I saw the famous White Horse Hill. It is said that the figure of the White
Horse on the hill was first made by Alfred the Great a thousand years ago,
to commemorate the defeat of the
Danes,&mdash;the White Horse being the
standard or national emblem of the
Danish chief. Whatever may have
been its origin, it is <em>now</em> made by annually
cutting about an acre of turf
away from the chalk beneath it. This
work is performed during a festival in
its honor, and is called &ldquo;Scouring the
White Horse.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadboth" style="width: 248px;">

<img src="images/zje068.jpg" width="248" height="350"
alt="A tower on wheels, the house of a migrating citizen" />
</div>

<p>While in Berkshire I saw an odd
picture, not of a castle, but of an old
English gentleman&rsquo;s residence, which
was truly castle-like in appearance,
and which furnishes a happy suggestion
to people who do not like to
live long in any one place. It was a
tun on wheels, and it had been used
by an overtaxed and indignant democrat
for the purpose of having no
fixed locality, and so to avoid assessment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
In London I made a study of the cheapest way of getting to Paris, and of
seeing the most on the journey. I found I could take a returning produce boat
at Southampton for Lower Normandy at a trifling cost, and could go on a
produce train from Caen to Paris as inexpensively.</p>

<p>We took a third-class ticket to Southampton. What a delightful ride it
was! Out of the smoke of London into the blossoming country, among landscapes
of cottages and gardens,&mdash;thatched cottages, cottages covered with old
red tiles, cottages whose gardens seemed to climb up embankments to the
roofs; past wheat fields so full of poppies that they seemed like poppy-fields
in full bloom! I saw one field
completely covered with red,
purple, yellow, and white poppies.
It was an exquisitely
beautiful sight,&mdash;nothing but
bright color.</p>

<p>The steamer we took was
employed simply for the exportation
of Normandy butter,
potatoes, and other farm produce.
It comes to England
loaded, and goes back empty.
I obtained passage for 10 francs,
and what I saved by travel on
the water I intended to make up
by a longer trip by land.</p>

<p>We were much tossed about
by the tides of the English
Channel, but arrived safely at
Cherbourg, and went by rail
immediately to Bayeux, a
dreamy, ecclesiastical city that
the battles of the past seem
to have left in strange silence.
I spoke at the beginning of my
letter of the activity and thrift of Lower Normandy, but Bayeux is the stillest
city I ever saw.</p>

<p class="caption">FAC-SIMILE OF THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY.</p>

<p>Here, in the Public Library, we saw the famous Bayeux Tapestry, which is
displayed under a glass case; is two hundred and fourteen feet long and contains
over fifteen hundred figures. The canvas is embroidered in woollen thread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
of various colors, the work of Matilda and her maids. I make a copy from a
sample picture of the exact size of the thread used.</p>

</div>

<p>One may read on this fabric the history of the
Norman Conquest of England. It is the most novel
work of history I ever saw.</p>

<p>The farming districts of Normandy seem indeed like Arcadia: farmers
mean business here, and thrive by thrift. Their sons and daughters, I am told,
do not run off to the city. I have never seen a people whose habits I like so
well.</p>

<p class="sig">Give our regards to all.<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">George Howe.</span></p>

<p>P. S. We are on our way to Paris, riding through a country of old
churches, castles, and flowers, on a produce train.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;that George and Leander are, after
all, making a very delightful tour; they certainly are getting better
views of common, practical life abroad than we are. I am glad that
they had the independence to make the journey in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you think their whole tour will cost them?&rdquo; asked
Ernest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will cost each of them less than either you or I have paid for
a single ocean passage,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>The boys spent the afternoon in letter-writing.</p>

<p>Tommy Toby wrote a long letter to George Howe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have taken George into my confidence,&rdquo; said he, after tea, as
Master Lewis and the boys were sitting by the open windows of the
hotel, &ldquo;and have given him an account of my hunting adventure in
Nottingham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you read the letter to us,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>Tommy, whose nature would not allow him to keep a secret long,
however disparaging to himself, seemed pleased to accept Master
Lewis&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address"><span class="smcap">Oxford</span>, July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>We are all pleased with the trip you are making.</p>

<p>We have been to lots of curious places,&mdash;dust heaps of old kings and
queens and <em>we have heard a lark sing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
At Nottingham I bought a bow and arrows, and went hunting. Like you,
I wanted to see the country.</p>

<p>I saw it.</p>

<p>They are very inquisitive people around Nottingham. They seem to want
to know your business before you are introduced.</p>

<p>A little way out of the city I came to a fine old tract of country. A gate
opened into some large, hilly fields, and there was a path through the fields that
seemed to lead to the wood.</p>

<p>I opened the gate and was going towards the wood, when I heard a voice
from the road,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked around, and made no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are yer going, <em>yer honor</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going hunting,&rdquo; said I; and I walked on very fast.</p>

<p>I came to a wooded hill, and the scenery all around was delightful, just like
a picture. Below the hill was a long pasture, and through it ran a stream of
water overhung with old trees. Under the trees were some cattle.</p>

<p>I was going down towards the pasture when I heard a very distressing
noise,&mdash;</p>

<p>O-o-o-o-o!</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an English landscape,&rdquo; said I to myself. &ldquo;How much more lovely
it is than castles, abbeys, and tombs!&rdquo; and I was trying to think of some
poetry, such as Frank would have quoted, when I heard that alarming sound
again,&mdash;</p>

<p>O-o-o-o-o!</p>

<p>I noticed that one of the fine animals had separated himself from the rest of
the herd by the shady brook, and was coming out to meet me, looking very
important. Presently he put down his head, gave the earth a scrape with his
foot, and then came jumping towards me, bounding and plunging over the
hillocks, like a ship on a heavy sea.</p>

<p>I turned right around, just as I did when I saw the bear, and I remembered
that Master Lewis might not like to have me venture too far in my first hunting
expedition.</p>

<p>I ran! didn&rsquo;t I run? I soon heard the same deep sound again, &ldquo;nearer,
clearer, deadlier than before,&rdquo; as the reading book says.</p>

<p>I had almost regained the top of the hill, when the animal bellowed almost
right behind me. There was a tree close by, and I went <em>up</em>. It was just as
easy for me to climb it as though it had been a ladder.</p>

<p>The animal bounded up the hill, and stood under the tree, pawing the earth
and making the same hollow noise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
I drew my bow, and let fly an arrow at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, come down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a thick, fat man, with a great stomach, coming up the hill. He
appeared greatly excited, and quite out of breath. He presently arrived at the
foot of the tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy, bring me that bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I came down the tree more scared at the man than I was at the animal. I
handed him the bow, and what do you think he did with it?</p>

<p>He gave me a dreadful cut across my back, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d yer come from? Take <em>that</em> and <small>THAT</small>, and THAT, and don&rsquo;t yer
ever trespass on my grounds again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I promised him I never would.</p>

<p>I walked just as fast as I could towards the gate, and when I came to the
road I was so flustrated that I went the wrong way, and wandered about in the
heat for hours before I could get rightly directed towards Nottingham.</p>

<p>I wish you were with us at Oxford; it seems to me the most beautiful place
in all the world.</p>

<p>It was here we heard the skylark sing.</p>

<p class="sig smcap">Tommy.</p>
</div>

<p>The next journey of the Club was indeed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en zigzag</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have allowed you to visit,&rdquo; said Master Lewis to the boys, &ldquo;the
places to which your reading has led your curiosity, most of which
places I have visited before. I now wish to take you to a ruin that I
have never seen, and of which you may have never heard. It is the
place where, according to tradition, Christianity was first established
in Great Britain; where St. Patrick is said to have preached, and where
he was buried. It is the place which poetry associates with the
mission and miracles of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a; here his staff, in the
shape of the white thorn, is said to blossom every Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glastonbury Abbey,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn. &ldquo;Of course there can
be no truth in the tradition of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a and the White
Thorn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story of Joseph&rsquo;s mission to England, his burial here, and
his blooming staff,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;is undoubtedly a fiction, like
the legend which claims that the stone in the old Scottish Coronation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
Chair in Westminster Abbey is the one on which Jacob rested when
he saw the vision of angels. But Glastonbury Abbey was possibly
the first Church in England. Here were the monuments of King
Arthur, King Edmund, and King Edgar; and even old King Coel,
St. David, and St. Dunstan are said to have been buried here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! the St. Dunstan that the devil tried to tempt?&rdquo; asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The St. Dunstan that the devil did tempt, I fear,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to hear the story of his temptations,&rdquo; said Tommy,
&ldquo;as we are going to Glastonbury.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>THE STORY OF ST. DUNSTAN&rsquo;S TEMPTATION.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;St. Dunstan,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;was Abbot of Glastonbury
Abbey, and was a very ambitious man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He caused a cell to be made in which he could neither stand
erect nor lie down with comfort. He retired to this cell and there
spent his time in working as a smith, and&mdash;so the report went&mdash;in
devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the people said, &lsquo;How humble and penitent Dunstan is!
He has the back-ache all day, and the legs-ache all night, and he suffers
all for the cause of purity and truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Dunstan told the people that the devil came to tempt him,
which, with his aches for the good cause, made his situation very trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil, he said, wanted him to lead a life of selfish gratification,
but he would not be tempted to do a thing like that; he never
thought of himself. O no, good soul, not he!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people said that Dunstan must have become a very holy
man, or the devil would not appear to him <em>bodily</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil came to him one day, he said, as he was at work at his
forge, and, putting his nose through the window of his cell, tempted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
him to lead a life of pleasure. He quickly drew his pincers from the
fire, and seized his tormentor by the nose, which put him in such pain
that he bellowed so lustily as to shake the hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy-king Edred, who filled the throne at this time, was in
poor health, and suffered from a lingering illness for years. He felt
the need of the counsel of a good man, and he said to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is Dunstan, a man who has given up all selfish feelings
and aspirations, a man whom even the devil cannot corrupt. I will
bring him to court, and will make him my adviser.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then pure-hearted Edred brought the foxy prelate to his court,
and made him, of all things in the world, the royal treasurer; and he
took such good care of the money entrusted to his keeping that he
was speedily released from the responsibility. He seems to have been
very easily tempted during his political career.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the party was borne away from shady Oxford,
where one would indeed like to tarry long in the midsummer days, to
the old city of Bristol, famous in the Roman conquest of Britain. In
the journey the gay poppy-fields and the picturesque cottage scenes,
which give a charm to the English landscape, often flitted into and out
of view, reminding the boys of George Howe&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>Glastonbury Abbey is indeed an interesting ruin. It stands
apart from the popular lines of travel, and so it figures little in the
narratives of those who make short tours abroad.</p>

<p>Think of the ruins of a church at least fourteen hundred years
old! A church that Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, who provided the tomb
for Jesus, is reputed in the old monkish legends to have founded, and
where St. Patrick and St. Augustine probably did preach, and where
in the Middle Ages the remains of good King Arthur were disenterred!</p>

from the ruin stands the beautiful Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn, &ldquo;that the old English
people liked to believe that their church sprang from the mission of
so amiable a saint as St. Joseph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;was really first established in
Great Britain in 596 by St. Augustine and forty missionaries who
came with St. Augustine
from Rome to preach to the
Anglo-Saxons. These missionaries
were kindly received
by King Ethelbert,
whose wife was already a
Christian. It is related that
one of the Saxon priests, to
see if indeed his gods would
be angry, went forth on
horse-back, and smote the
images the people had been
worshipping. To the astonishment
of the Saxons no
judgment followed. The
king was baptized, and the
missionaries baptized ten
thousand converts in a single
day in the river Swale.
The Christian religion had
been preached in Britain before,
but not generally accepted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the association of St. Joseph&rsquo;s name with this old ruin so
well,&rdquo; said Wyllys, &ldquo;that I wish to see the staff that you say is believed
to bloom at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
On the south side of Glastonbury is Weary-all Hill. It owes its
name to a very poetic legend. It is said that St. Joseph and his companions,
<em>all</em> of them <em>weary</em> in one of their missionary journeys, here
sat down to rest, and the Saint planted his staff into the earth, and
left it there. From it, we are told, springs the famous Glastonbury
Thorn which blossoms every Christmas, and whose miraculous flowers
were adored in the Middle Ages. Such a shrub still remains which
blooms in midwinter, and perpetuates the memory of the pretty
superstition.</p>

<p><span class="dct04"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE train, from its sinuous windings among old English landscapes
and thickly populated towns, seemed at last to be
gliding into a new world of vanishing houses and streets.
It suddenly stopped under the glass roof of an immense
station, where a regiment of porters in uniform were awaiting it, and
where all outside seemed a world of cabmen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">London!</span>&mdash;the world&rsquo;s great city, the nations&rsquo; bazaar,&mdash;where humanity
runs in no fixed channels, but ceaselessly ebbs and flows like
the sea. Cabs, cabs! then a swift rattle through rattling vehicles,
going in every direction, on, on, on! Names of places read in histories
and story-books pass before the eye. The tides of travel everywhere
seem to overflow; all is bewildering, confusing. What a map
a man&rsquo;s mind must be to thread the innumerable streets of London!</p>

<p>The Class stopped at a popular hotel in a fine part of the city,
called the West End. It is pleasanter and more economical to take
furnished lodgings in London, if one is to remain in the city for a
week or more, but as Master Lewis was to allow the boys but a few
days&rsquo; visit, he took them to a hotel in a quarter where the best London
life could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
The London cabs meet the impatient stranger&rsquo;s wants at once,
and the boys were soon rattling in them about the city, out of the
quarter of stately houses into the gay streets of trade, which seemed
to them indeed like a great world&rsquo;s fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
&ldquo;This is Pall Mall [Pell Mell],&rdquo; said Frank to Tommy, as their
cab rounded a corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be all <em>pell mell</em> here,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;Had the poet
been to London when he wrote,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, then and there was hurrying to and fro&rsquo;?<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this street has a more quiet look. What splendid houses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;are the houses of the famous London
Clubs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first visit that the boys made was to that time-honored pile of
magnificence into which kings and queens for centuries have gone to
be crowned and been carried to be buried,&mdash;Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>The party entered at the western entrance, which commands an
awesome, almost oppressive, view of the interior. In the softened
light of the stained windows rose a forest of columns, rich with art
and grandly gloomy with the associations of antiquity. Far, far away
it stretched to the chapel of Edward the Confessor, a name that led
the mind through the faded pomps of the past almost a thousand
years.</p>

<p>Monuments of kings and queens, benefactors and poets, beginning
with old Edward the Confessor and coming down to the Stuarts;
of Eleanor, who sucked the poison from her husband&rsquo;s wounds, and
Philippa, who saved the heroes of Calais. Here Bloody Mary, Queen
Elizabeth, and Mary, Queen of Scots, sleep in peace in the same
chapel; and here the merry monarch, Charles II., lies among the kingly
tombs without a slab to mark the place.</p>

<p>The new Houses of Parliament which stand between the Abbey
and the Thames are the finest works of architecture that have been
erected in England for centuries. They form a parallelogram nine
hundred feet long and three hundred feet wide. The House of Lords
and House of Commons occupy the centre of the building. Between
these two halls of State rises a tower three hundred feet high. At
each end of the building are lofty towers; the Victorian Tower, three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
hundred forty-six feet high, and a clock tower, in which the hours are
struck on a bell called Big Ben, which weighs nine tons.</p>

<p>The entrance to the Houses of Parliament is through old Westminster
Hall, ninety feet high and two hundred and ninety long, whose
gothic roof of wood is the finest specimen of its kind in English art,
and is regarded as one of the wonders of human achievement.</p>

<p>It was in this hall that Charles I. was tried for treason, and condemned;
and it was here, at the trial, that the words of a mysterious
lady smote Oliver Cromwell to the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prisoner at the bar has been brought here in the name of
the People of England,&rdquo; said the solicitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not half the people!&rdquo; exclaimed a mysterious voice in the gallery.
&ldquo;Oliver Cromwell is a <em>traitor</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The assembly shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire upon her!&rdquo; said an officer.</p>

<p>They did not fire. It was Lady Fairfax.</p>

<p>Westminster Bridge, one thousand one hundred and sixty feet long,
is near the clock tower, and here the Class took its best view of the
Parliament Houses.</p>

<p>The next day the Class visited London Tower and the relics that
recall the long list of tragedies of ambitious courts and kings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the guide, as the Class was taken into an apartment
in the White Tower, an old prison whose walls are twelve feet thick,
&ldquo;is the beheading block that was used on Tower Hill. The Earl of
Essex was beheaded on it: see the <em>dints</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An axe stood beside the block, which is kept on exhibition in one
of the rooms in which Sir Walter Raleigh was confined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were the children of Edward murdered?&rdquo; asked Frank
Gray, after being shown the place of the execution of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the Bloody Tower,&rdquo; said the guide. &ldquo;I am not hallowed to
admit visitors into that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are a class in an American school. Could you not make some
arrangement to admit us?&rdquo; asked Wyllys.</p>

The guide left the party a few minutes, and then returned with a
bunch of keys.</p>

<p>He led the way to a small room in which the little sons of Edward
had been lodged, to be accessible to the murderers. Here the unhappy
children were smothered in bed. The room, apart from its dreadful
associations, was a pleasant one looking out on the Thames.</p>

<p>The party was next shown the stairs at the foot of which the
remains of the princes were discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, &ldquo;the life of the boys in the
Tower. How they went from window to window and looked out on
the Thames, the sunlight, and the sky as we do now; how they saw
the bright, happy faces pass, and children in the distance at play; how
they watched, it may be, the lights in their dead father&rsquo;s palace at
night, and how they wondered why the freedom of the gay world
beyond the prison was denied them. It is said that an old man who
loved them used to play on some instrument in the evening under the
walls of the Tower, and thus express to them his sympathy which he
could not do in words.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The burial of Richard III., who caused the death of the royal
children,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;was almost as pitiful as that of the
princes themselves. After the fatal battle, his naked body was thrown
upon a sorry steed and carried over the bridge to Leicester amid
derision and scorn. For two hot summer days it was exposed to the
jeers of the mob, and then was laid in a tomb costing &pound;10 1<i>s.</i>, to rest
fifty years. The tomb was dashed in pieces during the Reformation,
the bones thrown into the river and the stone coffin, according to
tradition, used as a horse-trough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collection of armor in an apartment of the Tower called the
Horse Armory, a building over one hundred and fifty feet long, presented
a spectacle that filled our visitors with wonder. It seemed like
a sudden reproduction of the faded days of chivalry. On each side
of the room was a row of knights in armor, in different attitudes, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
as though they were real knights under some spell of enchantment,
waiting for the magic word to start them into life again.</p>

<p class="caption">BURIAL OF RICHARD.</p>

<p>The Jewel Tower did not so much excite the boys&rsquo; astonishment.
It was like a costumer&rsquo;s shop; and even the royal crown of England
wore an almost ridiculous look, civilization and republican progress
have so far outgrown these theatrical playthings. The Queen&rsquo;s
diadem, as it is called, was indeed a glitter of diamonds, and the royal
sceptres of various devices carried one back to the days of Queen
Esther.</p>

&ldquo;Among the stories told of the prisoners in the Tower,&rdquo; said
Master Lewis, &ldquo;there is one that is pleasant to remember. Sir Henry
Wyat was confined here in a dark low cell, where he suffered from
cold and hunger. A cat came to visit him at times, and used to lie
in his bosom and warm him. One day the cat caught a pigeon and
brought it to him to eat. The keeper heard of pussy&rsquo;s devotion to the
prisoner, and treated him more kindly. When Wyat was released, he
became noted for his fondness for cats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving the Tower, the boys stopped to look at the Traitor&rsquo;s Gate,
which had clanged behind so many illustrious prisoners brought to
the prison in the fatal barge; Cranmer, More, Anne Boleyn, bad men
and good men, how it swung behind them all, and ended even hope!
With sober faces the boys turned away.</p>

<p>The Zo&ouml;logical Gardens in Regent&rsquo;s Park presented the boys, on
the day after their visit to the Tower, a more cheerful scene. Who
that has read of the London &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo; has not wished to visit it? Here
specimens of the whole animal kingdom may be seen, and one wanders
among the immense cages, artificial ponds, bear-pits, enclosures of
tropical animals, reptile dens, feeling as free and secure as Adam
appears in the picture of Naming the Creation.</p>

<p>Here, unlike a menagerie, the animals all have room for the comforts
of existence. The rhinoceroses have a pond in which to stand
in the mud, and the hippopotami may sport as in their native rivers.</p>

<p>The British Museum, with its Roman sculptures, Elgin marbles,
and almost innumerable classic antiquities, and St. Paul&rsquo;s with its
fifty monuments of England&rsquo;s heroes and benefactors, presented to the
Class an extended view of the world&rsquo;s history. Sight-seeing became
almost bewildering, and when it was asked what place they next should
visit, Tommy Toby replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I had seen almost enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us visit Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s wax works,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they like Mrs. Jarley&rsquo;s &lsquo;wax figgers?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Tommy; &ldquo;if so I
would like to go. Who was Madame Tussaud?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
&ldquo;She was a little French lady who took casts of faces of great
men, sometimes after their death or execution, and who died herself
some twenty or more years ago, at the age of ninety years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The price of the exhibition was a shilling, and&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the Chamber of Horrors a sixpence hextra,&rdquo; said the man
admitting the party. Each one paid the &ldquo;hextra&rdquo; sixpence.</p>

<p>There were three hundred figures in all, supposed to be exact
representations of the persons when living. In a room called the
Hall of Kings were fifty figures of kings and queens, reproducing to
the life these generally condemned players on the stage of English
history.</p>

<p>A clever, winsome old man sat on one of the benches in the place,
holding a programme in his hand, and now and then raising his head,
as from studying the paper, to scrutinize one or another of the astonishing
works of art.</p>

<p>Tommy sat down beside the much interested, benevolent-looking
old gentleman, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not <em>George</em> Wilkes Booth who killed President Lincoln,
it was&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if this don&rsquo;t cap the whole! Why, <em>you</em> are a &lsquo;figger,&rsquo; too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the mild, attentive-looking old gentleman proved to be.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Horrors revived the feeling the visitors had
felt in the Tower. It was a collection of representations of criminals.
Among the relics is the blade of the guillotine used during the
Reign of Terror in France, which is said to have cut off two thousand
heads.</p>

<p>Hampton Court Palace, the gift of Cardinal Wolsey to Henry

gave a king, next received our tourists&rsquo; attention. The palace originally
consisted of five courts, only a part of which now remain, but
which assist the fancy in stereoscoping the old manorial splendor.
Here Wolsey lived in vice-regal pomp, and had nearly one thousand

persons to do his house-keeping, and noble lords, on state occasions,
waited upon him upon bended knees.</p>

<p>The establishment at this time contained fifteen hundred rooms.</p>

<p>Edward VI., the last of the boy-kings of England, a youth noted
for his piety and love of learning, was born here, and here spent in
scholarly occupations a part of his short life. Catharine Howard, who
for a long time held the affections of Henry VIII., and who in his
best years greatly influenced his conduct by her wisdom and accomplishments,
was first acknowledged as queen here; and here also
Henry married another Catharine,&mdash;Catharine Parr, his sixth and last
wife. Bloody Mary kept Christmas here in 1557, when the great hall
was lighted with one thousand lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
Our visitors found Hampton Court open to the public,&mdash;a place of
rare freedom where people go out from London and enjoy the grounds
much as though it were their own. It is in fact a grand picture
gallery and a public garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wolsey gave this palace to the king,&rdquo; said Master Lewis; &ldquo;and
the king was sporting in the palace when he received the news of the
death of the Cardinal, who was stricken with a mortal sickness near
Leicester Abbey, soon after having been arrested for high treason.
The sad event did not seem to give the king the slightest pain. Such
is the value of the presents of a corrupt friendship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charles I. resided here at times. Here he brought his young
bride when all London was reeking with the pestilence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
&ldquo;Charles had three
beautiful children, and was
fond of their company.
Once, it is said, when he
was with them at a window
of Hampton Court
Palace, a gypsy appeared
before him and asked for
charity. He and the children
laughed at her grotesque
appearance, which
angered her, when she took
from her basket a glass
and held it up to the
king. He looked into it
and saw his head severed
from his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king gave her
money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A dog shall die in
this room,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and
then the kingdom which
you will lose shall be restored to your family.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many years passed; and Oliver Cromwell, attended by his faithful
dog, came to Hampton Court Palace and slept in this room. When
he awoke in the morning, the dog was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The kingdom has departed from me,&rsquo; he said, recalling the gypsy&rsquo;s
prophecy; and so it proved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the story of the gypsy&rsquo;s mirror is untrue, but the legend
is a part of the old romance of the palace; and such poetic incidents,
though false colored lights, serve to impress the facts of history more
vividly on the mind.</p>

<h3>THE DUCHESS&rsquo;S WONDERFUL PIE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There were gala days at Paris,&mdash;wedding days. Then the new
Queen of England, Henrietta Maria, who had been married amid
music and rejoicings and strewings of flowers, made a journey to the
sea, that she might embark for England and see her new husband to
whom she had been married by proxy. There were more rejoicings
when she landed at Dover.</p>

&ldquo;There was one reception which the duke gave to the royal bride
and bridegroom that was a surprise and delight. It was a banquet;
the tables were sumptuous and splendid, and on one of them was a very
large pie,&mdash;as large as that is supposed to be in which the four-and-twenty
blackbirds of nursery-rhyme fame are said to have been
concealed. The pie excited wonder, but the guests all knew that it
was some</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;&lsquo;Dainty dish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To set before the king.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The banquet passed gayly, and the time came to serve the wonderful
pie. The crust was being removed, when instead of four-and-twenty
blackbirds flying out, up popped a little man. He was a chipper
little fellow, yet very polite, and was armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-&agrave;-pie</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the first introduction of Jeffrey Hudson to the English
king and queen. The pie had been purposely constructed to hold
the little fellow, who, when the duchess made an incision in his castle
of paste, shifted his situation until sufficient room was made for his
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The queen expressing herself greatly pleased with his person and
manners, the duchess presented him to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This dwarf became very famous in the court of the queen.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">The third day in London was given to the boys as their own.
They were allowed by Master Lewis to go to such places as best
suited their tastes. The prudent teacher had adopted this plan before,
believing that the boys needed it to teach them self-reliance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will you go to-day?&rdquo; asked Frank Gray of Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Punch-and-Judy hunting,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;The streets of London
are full of exhibitions; the queerest performances you ever saw.
I have been wishing some time for a chance to see sights for myself.
Will you go with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Punch-and-Judy hunting?&rdquo; said Frank, contemptuously. &ldquo;No;
I am going to make an excursion to Cambridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, who had heard Tommy&rsquo;s remark,
&ldquo;that London is a wilderness of streets. You must not wander far
from any principal street. Never lose sight of the cabs and omnibuses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel perfectly sure that I shall need no other help than the
cabman&rsquo;s in finding my way back. I have taken ten shillings in my
purse in case of an emergency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your purse in your pocket wherever you find yourself,&rdquo; said
Master Lewis. &ldquo;Punch-and-Judy crowds have not the credit of being
the most honest people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy found the hunting for street performances indeed alluring.
Every court and alley seemed alive with the most remarkable entertainments
a boy could witness.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 282px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">STREET AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>He first met three grotesque
musicians who had
gathered around them an
audience of admiring
house-maids, dilatory market-people,
and unkempt
children. But the hat for
contributions was passed
so soon after he joined
himself to the music-loving
company that he at
once left for another performance
where the call
for money might not be
so pressing. A fiddler
with three performing
dogs, that were bedecked
with hats and ruffles, quite
exceeded in dramatic interest the former exhibition. But the fiddler,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
too, had immediate need of money, and Tommy remembered Master
Lewis&rsquo;s caution about the purse, and passed on to a public place that
seemed quite alive with groups of people gathered around curious
sights and entertainments.</p>

<p>The pastimes here took a scientific turn.
Chief among these street showmen rose the
tall head of a middle-aged gentleman&mdash;&ldquo;the
professor&rdquo;&mdash;who administered the
&ldquo;galvanic grip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has fast has yer cured, gentlemen, pass
right along, pass right along, and give others
a chance. &rsquo;Ave you han hache or a pain?
I say, &rsquo;ave you han hache or a pain? Cure ye
right hup, right hup hin a minute. I&rsquo;ll tell
you what, it is astonishing, gentlemen, what
cures science will perform.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">STREET AMUSEMENTS.</p>

<p>At this point some one not schooled in
the mysteries of science received a very liberal
dose of the &ldquo;magnetic grip,&rdquo; and
doubled his body with an &ldquo;O!&rdquo; that seemed
to be shot out of him, when the crowd laughed and moved on.</p>

<p>You pay your five or ten pence and are presented with the handles
forming the terminations of the electric wire: you grasp these as tight
as you can, one in either hand, while the galvanist grinds away at the
machine.</p>

<p>When a hundred or more eyes are levelled upon you he suddenly
increases the motion in a manner that leaves no doubt in your mind
that that man has magnetism about him, whether he be a &ldquo;professor&rdquo;
or not. Of course your rheumatism at once disappears: it would do
the same had you fallen from the roof of a house.</p>

<p>Tommy had a strong inclination to be &ldquo;cured&rdquo; by the &ldquo;professor
of galvanism,&rdquo; but he conscientiously recalled Master Lewis&rsquo;s advice
about the purse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
A man with a wonderfully bedecked performing monkey was leaving
the square, and, as a sort of testimony to the attraction of his
exhibition, a crowd of boys and girls were following him. Tommy
wished to see a performance that had evidently excited so much
interest, and he allowed himself to be borne along after the man in
the juvenile tide. After passing through several streets, the performer
stopped in an open court, but for some reason was ordered
away. Tommy found himself left almost alone in an antique-looking
place, where there were in sight neither omnibuses nor cabs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is the way to Regent Street?&rdquo; asked Tommy of a sad-looking
little girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Sad Eyes; &ldquo;&rsquo;ave ye got a penny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For tellin&rsquo; ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy made other inquiries, but received about as definite information
as at first, and each person followed
the unsatisfactory answer with,
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ave ye a penny?&rdquo; as though it was
worth that trifling amount to open one&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>

<p>An honest-looking house-wife, without
bonnet or shawl, came marching
along the street with an air of friendly
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you direct me to a street where
I can find a hack?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess yer lost, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will be so kind as to direct
me to Regent Street or Oxford Street, or
Pall Mall, I will pay you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
Tommy felt in his pocket for his purse. It was <em>not</em> there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me yer hand, little boy,&rdquo; said the benevolent-looking dame.</p>

<p>The two walked on through several streets, when the woman
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This street will take you to Oxford Street. &rsquo;Ave you got a
penny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tommy; &ldquo;I have lost it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you blackguard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy did not stop to hear any figurative language, but found
his way to Oxford Street as quickly as possible, and took with him to
the hotel so deep a sense of humiliation that he did not relate the
misadventure and loss to his companions.</p>

<p>In the evening of the boys&rsquo; &ldquo;own&rdquo; day, George Howe and Leander
Towle arrived unexpectedly at the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;to bid you good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why good-by?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been abroad a fortnight,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;have seen the
capitals of Scotland, England, and France; have rode through the
heart of England and the most interesting part of Normandy, and, as
our money is more than half gone, we must return. The steamer
leaves to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will the whole trip cost you?&rdquo; asked Wyllys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will cost us each $56.00 for the ocean passage both ways, and
our travelling expenses and board for the two weeks have averaged to
each $2.00 per day, or $28.00. The trip will cost me, well&mdash;when I
have made some purchases&mdash;say $95.00, though I have not yet spent
as much as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you obtained your return tickets?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me advise you not to take steerage passage in returning. The
steerage will be crowded, and you will in that case find it no holiday
experience. Take a second-cabin ticket for $40.00.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My expenses then will not greatly exceed $100.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
&ldquo;Another steamer sails in a few days,&rdquo; said Master Lewis; &ldquo;accept
my invitation to remain with us over to-morrow, and visit Windsor
Castle with us. It shall add nothing to your expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were delighted to accept Master Lewis&rsquo;s generous proposal.
It was arranged that the next morning the whole party should
go to Windsor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we go to Windsor Castle,&rdquo; said Frank Gray to Master
Lewis, &ldquo;will you not tell us something about the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Windsor Castle,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;is the finest of English
palaces, and is one of the residences of the royal family. In its
park, Prince Albert lies buried in the mausoleum erected by the
queen. Perhaps I cannot better instruct you for the visit than by
telling you the story of</p>


<h3>PRINCE ALBERT AND HIS QUEEN.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;For seventeen years Queen Victoria has mourned for one of the
best husbands and one of the wisest advisers that ever a female sovereign
had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage of Victoria and Albert was a love-match; not a
very common thing in unions of princes and princesses. They were
first cousins, Albert&rsquo;s father and Victoria&rsquo;s mother having been brother
and sister, the children of the Duke of Coburg; but, when they became
engaged, their situations were very different. Victoria was the
young queen of one of the mightiest and proudest empires on earth;
Albert was only the younger son of a poor and petty German prince,
&lsquo;across whose dominion one might walk in half a day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But their relationship and the plans of their family served to
bring them together at a very early age, and they were very young
when their union was first thought of. Old King Leopold of Belgium
was the uncle of both of them; and it was he who first conceived the
idea of their marriage. But not a word was said to either of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
about it until an affection had grown up between them, and it was
time for the young queen to choose a partner for her heart and throne.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">VICTORIA AT THE AGE OF EIGHT.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Albert and Victoria met for the
first time when they were both seventeen
years old. The young prince
and his brother went to England to
pay a visit to their aunt and cousin,
and the young couple were brought
together. Albert at that time was
rather short and thick-set, but fine-looking,
rosy-cheeked, natural and
simple in his manners, and of a cheerful
disposition. He took a great deal
of interest in every thing about him,
and while on his visit to England spent much time in playing on the
piano with his cousin Victoria, who was then a slight, graceful, and
interesting girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She fell in love with him at once; but he, though he liked her,
was not so quickly impressed. He wrote to his Uncle Leopold that
&lsquo;our cousin is very amiable,&rsquo; but had no stronger praise for her.
Albert then returned to the continent, and spent some years in travel
and study, writing occasionally to Victoria and she to him. Meanwhile,
King William IV. died, and Victoria, in her eighteenth year,
ascended the British throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young prince&rsquo;s next visit took place in the year after this
event, and now his object was to plead for the hand and heart of the
young queen. Victoria could scarcely believe her eyes when she saw
him. The short, thick-set boy had grown into a tall, comely youth,
with elegant manners and a strikingly handsome face. Soon after, she
wrote to her Uncle Leopold, &lsquo;Albert&rsquo;s beauty is most striking, and he
is most amiable and unaffected,&mdash;in short, very fascinating.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few days after his arrival, Victoria had made up her mind;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
and, sending for Lord Melbourne, the prime minister, told him that
she was going to marry Prince Albert. The next day she sent for
the prince; and &lsquo;in a genuine outburst of heartiness and love&rsquo; she
declared to him that he had gained her whole heart, and would make
her very happy if he would share his life with her. He responded
with warm affection, and thus they became betrothed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The queen not only thus &lsquo;popped the question,&rsquo; but insisted that
the marriage should take place at an early day. This was in the
summer of 1839; and, in the early winter of 1840, the young couple
were married in the royal chapel of St. James, in the midst of general
rejoicing, and with great pomp and ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such was the beginning of a happy wedded life, which lasted for
over twenty years, and during which the love of each for the other
seemed to increase constantly. A little circle of children was soon
formed around the royal hearthstone, and the domestic life of the
palace was full of contentment and good order; and, as Victoria grew
older, she learned more and more of the excellent character that
Providence had given her for a husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Prince Albert assumed the direction of the family, and
was the unquestioned master of it in its private life, he was wise
enough to be very careful how he interfered with the queen in the
performance of her public duties. He knew that, as a foreigner, the
English would be very jealous of him if he took part in politics, or
tried to influence Victoria in her conduct as a ruler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the same time, the young queen, scarcely more than a girl,
needed a guiding hand, and one that she could trust. No one could
be so much trusted as her husband; and Albert gradually became her
adviser on public affairs, as well as the head of her household. At
first, there were many grumblings and complaints about this in England;
but as the purity and good sense of the prince became better
known, as it became evident that his ambition was to serve the queen
and the country, these complaints for the most part ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
&ldquo;Prince Albert devoted himself, with all his heart and mind, to the
duties which he found weighing upon him as a husband and father,
and as the most intimate counsellor of the monarch of a great country.
He denied himself many of the innocent pleasures which lay within
his reach, went but little into society, and spent his days and evenings
in serious occupations and in the midst of his happy family circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among other things, he took a very deep interest in the progress
of art, science, and education. &lsquo;His horses,&rsquo; says a writer, &lsquo;might be
seen waiting for him before the studios of artists, the museums of art
and science, the institutions for benevolence or culture, but never
before the doors of dissipation or mere fashion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Prince Albert who proposed and planned the great London
Exhibition of 1851, the first of the series of &lsquo;World&rsquo;s Fairs,&rsquo;
which have since been so frequently held, the latest being our own
Centennial; and when it had been resolved upon, it was Prince
Albert&rsquo;s labor and energy, more than that of any other, which made it
a success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In his own family circle Prince Albert was always kind, gentle,
and indulgent, but firm and resolute in his treatment of his children.
He took a great interest in their studies, and directed their education,
sometimes teaching them himself; and he bestowed an anxious and
fatherly care upon the formation of their manners and habits, and a
right training of their hearts and minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From first to last, he was as tenderly devoted to the queen as a
lover. He went with her everywhere, and his tastes and hers were
entirely congenial. Of a quiet and domestic disposition, he was amply
content to find his pleasures in the family circle; and Victoria took
a perpetual delight in his kind and cultivated companionship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Prince Albert died, in December, 1861, the queen was
overwhelmed with grief; and it was many years before she so far
recovered from it that she could bear to show herself in public, or to
take part in any social gathering or State ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
&ldquo;He was placed in a tomb in the beautiful park of Windsor, where
she had so often roamed with him in their early wedded life; and
every year, on the sad anniversary of his death, Victoria repairs to his
grave, and prays, and scatters flowers on the tomb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Windsor Castle had its
rise in early Saxon times,
and was made a fortress
by William the Conqueror.
Froissart says that King
Arthur instituted his Order
of the Knights of the Round
Table here. King John
dwelt here during the conferences
at Runnymede,
when the barons drove him
almost to madness by compelling
him to sign away his
royal claims by the acceptance
of the Magna Charta.</p>

<p>The situation of the
castle is most beautiful; it
overlooks the Thames, and
from its tower twelve counties
may be seen. The
home park of the palace
contains five hundred acres,
and this is connected with
Windsor Great Park, which has an area of one thousand eight hundred
acres.</p>

<p>The beauty of St. George&rsquo;s Chapel greatly excited the wonder of
our tourists. Here are the tombs of Henry VIII., Charles I., Georges
III. and IV., and William IV.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn, &ldquo;is the finest monument I have yet
seen in England. How beautifully the light is made to fall upon
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monument represented a dead princess, with a sheet thrown
over the body and couch, as though she had just expired. Above it
the spirit of the maiden is shown in the form of an angel ascending to
heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the tomb of the Princess Charlotte,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.
&ldquo;She was one of the most amiable princesses that ever won the affections
of the English people. Her death came like a private sorrow to
every family in the kingdom, and was the occasion of the most tender
public expressions of grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must tell you a story,&rdquo; continued Master Lewis, after standing
at the tomb of George III., &ldquo;that will soften your feelings, perhaps,
towards one whom, for political reasons, our own history has taught
us to regard as little worthy of respect; but who had great private
virtues, whatever may have been his political mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the bright avenue of elms, called the Long Walk, which connects
the home park with the Great Park of Windsor, Master Lewis
told the boys the story of the lamented Princess Amelia and her
unhappy father, who became insane from his loss, when she died. The
pathetic story made a great impression on the minds of the party, and
it was several hours before they resumed their accustomed air of
gayety and enjoyment. They returned to London in the late evening
twilight, and the next day the party separated. George Howe
and Leander Towle remained in London until the sailing of the next
steamer for America; and Master Lewis and the boys under his own
care took a steamer for Antwerp.</p>

<p>The Class stopped here only long enough to visit the
Cathedral, where are to be seen two of Rubens&rsquo; most
celebrated pictures, the Elevation of and the Descent from the Cross.
The boys climbed up to the belfry of the famous spire, whose bells
make the air tremble for miles with the melody of their chimes.</p>

<p>It was Master Lewis&rsquo;s plan to travel through the lower part of Belgium
and through Normandy by short journeys near the coast, but he
made a d&eacute;tour from Antwerp to Brussels that the boys might visit
the battlefield of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The landscape along the route to Brussels was dotted with quaint
windmills, reminding one of the old pictorial histories, in which Holland
is illustrated by cuts of these workshops of the air.</p>

<p>The boys entered the city in the morning and passed in view of the
great market square and its contiguous streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This city,&rdquo; said Frank Gray, &ldquo;was the scene of the grand military
ball before the Battle of Waterloo.</p>

<p>The unexpected street scenes and the general interest of the Class
in them so offended Frank that he turned his eyes with a far-away
look towards the highest gables, and passed on the rest of the way to
the Hotel de l&rsquo;Europe in silence.</p>

<p>The next morning the Class left the Place Royale, in a fine English
stage-coach, in company with an agent of the English mail coaches,
for Waterloo, which is about twelve miles from the city. It was a
bright day, and the airy road led through the forest of Soignies,&mdash;the
&ldquo;Ardennes&rdquo; of Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe Harold&rsquo;s Pilgrimage.&rdquo;</p>

a battle: it was a change of front of the nations of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Class stopped at Brussels on their return from the most peaceful
plain to take a view of the Hotel de Ville, which is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
finest town-halls in the country. Its tower is more than three hundred
and sixty feet high, and is surmounted with a colossal statue of St.
Michael, which looks very small indeed from the square, but which is
really seventeen feet high. The figure turns in the wind, and is the
weather vane of the city.</p>

&ldquo;I wish you to visit Aix-la-Chapelle,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;The
places you have seen in England and expect to see in Normandy will,
I hope, leave in your mind a clear view of English history, when you
shall associate them under my direction, as I purpose to have you do.
To have a view of French history you will need to learn something of
the old empire of Charlemagne, of which this city was the principal
capital on this side of the Alps. Here the great king of the Franks,
Roman Emperor, and virtual ruler of the world was born, had his
favorite residence, and here he was buried. Here, in 1165, his tomb
was opened, and his body was found seated upon a throne, crowned,
the sceptre in his hand, the Gospel on his knee, and all of the insignia
of imperial state about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through districts of pasture lands, by cliffs that looked like castles,
over clear streams and past populous villages our tourists made their
way to the old city of the emperor of the West. It is situated in a
valley, surrounded by heights. Its town hall was built on the ruins of
the palace of Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>

of Charlemagne.</p>

<p class="caption">CHARLEMAGNE AT THE HEAD OF HIS ARMY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlemagne, like Alfred of England,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;was a
patron of learning; and he instituted in his own palace a school for his
sons and servants. But he was a war-making king. He conducted in
all fifty-three expeditions in Germany, Gaul, Italy, and Greece, and
made himself the ruler of the greater part of Northern and Eastern
Europe. He went to Rome in 800 <small>A.D.</small> and received a most gracious
reception from the Pope, as in all his contests he had been a faithful
servant of the Church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Christmas day, 800 <small>A.D.</small> he went into St. Peter&rsquo;s to attend mass.
He took his place before the altar, and, as he bowed his head to pray,
the Pope placed the crown of the Roman Empire upon it, and all the
people shouted, &lsquo;Long live Charles Augustus, crowned of God, the
great Emperor of the Romans!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so the king of the Franks became the emperor of the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
The relics which the cathedral exhibits from time to time at great
public festivals are remarkable as illustrations of the influence of superstition.
Among the so-called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grandes Reliques</i> are the robe worn by
the Virgin at the Nativity and the swaddling clothes in which the
infant Saviour was wrapped. It would be almost irreverent to excite
ridicule by giving a list of the articles associated with the crucifixion
of Christ. Among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Petites Reliques</i> are pieces of Aaron&rsquo;s rod that
budded. Upon these pretended relics the German emperors used to
take the State oath at their coronations.</p>

The Class returned to Brussels, and thence made easy journeys
through a fertile and thickly settled country, towards Normandy.</p>

<p>Ghent, a grand old city of the commerce kings of Flanders, with its
quaint town-hall and its two hundred and seventy bridges, next met the
eager eyes of our tourists, who stopped here briefly on their way to
Bruges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never hear the name of Ghent pronounced,&rdquo; said Master Lewis,
&ldquo;without recalling the scene which history pictures of James van
Artevelde standing in the door of his house, when the burghers, tired
of the rule of kings and nobles, came to him for counsel, and asked
him to become their leader. It was really the burghers&rsquo; declaration of
independence, and the making one of their number,&mdash;for James van
Artevelde was a brewer,&mdash;president of the rich old city. This was
on the 26th of December, 1337. It was a bold stroke for liberty in
the days of tyranny, and the memory of it will ever live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know but little of the history of Bruges,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn to
Master Lewis, during the ride to that city. &ldquo;I have heard, of course,
of its belfry, and I also remember what Tommy said about it in his
story of Philip the Good and the Tinker. What makes the city so
famous?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was once,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;the greatest commercial port in
the world; a hundred and fifty foreign vessels would sometimes enter
its basins in a single day. Its inhabitants became very rich, and its
grandees lived like princes. A French queen who visited it in its high
prosperity is said to have exclaimed, &lsquo;I thought myself the only queen
here, but I see a thousand about me!&rsquo; Twenty ministers from foreign
courts had residences within its walls. It excelled all places in the
manufacture of wool; and in recognition of this fact Philip the Good
instituted there the Order of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an historic character whose name is associated with
Bruges in a very different way from Philip the Good,&mdash;a famous
son of Philip, who was called</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHARLES THE RASH.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;His surname is a picture of his character, and it seems strange that
so good a duke as Philip should have had so bad a son. To wage
war, harry and burn, to be engaged always in some work of destruction,
was the passion of his life. He devastated Normandy, destroying
more than two hundred castles and towns. He filled the land with
smoke, and colored the rivers with blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He succeeded to the ducal crown of Burgundy in 1467. Being
the richest prince of the times, he immediately began to make preparations
for war on a gigantic scale, which should add all the neighboring
territories and provinces to Burgundy. He desired to extend his
personal power at any expense of blood and treasure, and he mapped
out plans of conquest and dreamed dazzling dreams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While he was getting ready for war, Louis XI. of France invited
him to a conference: he hesitated, and Louis, through his partisans,
incited the citizens of Li&eacute;ge to revolt against him. Charles then
consented to the conference, but as soon as Louis arrived, he treacherously
seized him and made him his prisoner. He forced him to swear
a treaty on a box which was believed to contain pieces of the true
cross, and which had belonged to Charlemagne. He then compelled
him to go with him to Li&eacute;ge, and apparently to sanction the punishment
of the people for the very revolt he had incited them to make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He conquered Lorraine, and planned to subdue Switzerland and
add it to Burgundy. He entered Switzerland, captured Grandson,
and hanged and drowned the garrison. The Swiss rose unitedly
against such a merciless foe, and utterly defeated him. But he raised
another army and again entered Switzerland, full of visions of conquest.
He was again defeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came back to Burgundy, morose and gloomy. His nails and

him, and his dark character seemed to throw a shadow around him
wherever he appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lorraine, which he had conquered, rose against him. This roused
him again to action: he hired soldiers, and led the way to war. He
met the rebellious Lorrainers in the plain of Nancy. Here the rash
duke made his last fight. It was a snowy day, and the battle was a
short one,&mdash;the soldiers of Charles flying quickly before the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the duke was preparing himself for the battle, the gilt lion
which formed the crest of his helmet fell off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a sign from God,&rsquo; said he, smitten in conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the battle was over his body was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They searched for it in the snow-covered fields. At last a Roman
page said he had seen the duke fall. He led the people towards a
frozen pond, where were some bodies lying, stripped. A washerwoman
who had joined in the search, saw the glitter of a jewel on the hand of
a corpse whose face was not visible. The head was frozen in the ice.
The position of the body was changed. It was Charles the Rash. He
was finally buried in the church of Notre Dame, whose spire you may
already see shining in the sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The story of Charles the Rash led the Class to visit the old church
of Notre Dame soon after their arrival in the courtly old city. It had a
greater charm for the boys than the ornate town-hall with its famous
belfry and its many bells. In a side chapel was the tomb of the rash
duke and that of his daughter, Mary of Burgundy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can only think of the snowy field, and the naked body frozen in
the ice,&rdquo; said Ernest Wynn, as he left the solemn chapel.</p>

<p>The belfry of Bruges, of which so much has been said and sung, is
really only about three hundred feet high, but affords a grand view
of the surrounding country. Its chimes play by machinery four times
an hour, and are regarded the finest in Europe.</p>

<p>We must let Longfellow tell the charming story of his visit to the
old tower:&mdash;</p>

<p>On entering Normandy, Master Lewis engaged passages on diligences,
wherever a promise of a route amid pleasant scenery offered
itself. It seemed to be the boys&rsquo; greatest delight to ride on the top of
a diligence.</p>

<p>These French stage-coaches are lofty, lumbering vehicles, composed
of three parts. The front division is called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup&eacute;</i>, and is shaped somewhat
like an old-time chariot. It holds three persons. Next is the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">int&eacute;rieur</i> or inside, holding six persons, an apartment much shunned in
pleasant weather in summer time. Behind is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rotonde</i> which
collects &ldquo;dust, dirt, and bad company.&rdquo; Over all is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banquette</i>, a
castle-like position on the top of the coup&eacute;, a seat protected by a hood,
or head, and leather apron.</p>

<p>To secure this seat beside the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; was Tommy Toby&rsquo;s highest
ambition, when about to leave a newly visited place.</p>

<p>In one of these rides, when Tommy and Wyllys Wynn occupied
this high seat, Tommy said to the driver,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems strange to me to find such great forests in old countries
like England, Belgium, and France. I fancied that great tracts of
wood only existed in new lands like America, or half-civilized places.
Are there wild animals in the woods here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The driver was a French soldier, quite advanced in life. He spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
English well, and seemed to enjoy giving the largest possible information
to his seat companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are some wild animals left in the forest,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;of
the harmless kind. <em>Wild people</em> have sometimes been found in the
largest tracts of forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild people?&rdquo; asked Tommy, his curiosity greatly excited. &ldquo;Did
you ever see a wild man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not myself. Did you ever hear of Peter the Wild Boy found
in the woods in Hanover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a wild girl found in the French woods, not far from
Paris, about the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not tell us the story?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>The diligence lumbered along among the cool forest scenery,
between the walls of green trees which now and then, like suddenly
opened windows, afforded extended views; and the good-natured, well-informed
driver told the two boys the story of</p>


<h3>THE WILD GIRL OF SONGI.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;In the year 1731, as a nobleman was hunting at Songi, near the
ancient and historic town of Chalons, on the river Champagne, in
France, he discovered a couple of objects at a distance in the water,
at which he fired, supposing them to be birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They immediately disappeared, but arose at a point near the
shore, when they were found to be two children, evidently about a
dozen years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They carried to the shore some fish that they had caught, which
they tore in pieces with their teeth and devoured raw, without chewing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After their meal, one of them found a rosary, probably lost by some
devotee, with which she seemed highly delighted. She endeavored to
conceal it from her companion, but the latter made the discovery, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
filled with rage and jealousy, inflicted a severe blow on the hand containing
the treasure. The other returned the blow, striking her companion
on the head with a heavy missile, and bringing her to the
ground with a cry of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sisters, for such they probably were, parted. The one most
injured went towards the river and was never seen or heard of afterwards.
The other hurried off towards the hamlet of Songi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a strange and frightful-looking creature. Her color was
black, and her only clothing consisted of loose rags and the skins of
animals. The people of Songi fled to their houses and barred their
doors at the sight of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wandered about the place, greatly to the terror of the villagers,
but at last some adventurers determined to set a dog on her. She
awaited the attack coolly, but as soon as the monster came fairly within
her reach, she dealt him such a blow on the head as laid him lifeless
on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The astonished peasants kept at a safe retreating distance, not
wishing a personal encounter with such a creature. She endeavored to
gain admittance to some of the houses, but the quaking occupants, who
seem to have fancied that the evil one himself had made his appearance,
securely fastened their doors and windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She at length retired to the fields and climbed a tree, where she
sat, appearing to the spectators like an omen of ill to Songi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Viscount d&rsquo;Epinoy was stopping at Songi at this time, and,
supposing the creature to be a wild girl, offered a reward for her capture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The excitement in the hamlet cooling, a party was formed to secure
the reward. The wild girl still remained in the tree, evidently taking
repose. Thinking that she must be thirsty, a bucket of water was
placed at the foot of the tree. She descended, looking cautiously
around, and drank, but immediately ascended to the top of the tree, as
though fearful of injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
&ldquo;She was at length allured to descend by a woman, who held out to
her fish and fruit. She was seized by stout men, and taken to the seat
of the viscount. One of her first acts was to devour raw some wild
fowl, which she found in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After public curiosity had been satisfied, the viscount sent her to a
shepherd to be tamed. The latter found this no easy matter, and her
wildness and animal nature were exhibited in so marked a manner that
she became known as the shepherd&rsquo;s beast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sometimes escaped. Once she was missing over night, when
there came a terrible snow-storm, and the poor shepherd wandered in
search of her. He discovered her at last housed just as she had been
in childhood, in the branches of a tree. The wind blew and the snow
drifted around her, but she was loth to return. She had learned that
trouble dwells in houses, and here in the tree-top, if she was cold, she
was free. I wonder if she thought of her sister in whose arms she had
doubtless slept in the trees, in her childhood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her agility was marvellous. She would outrun the swiftest animals,
even the rabbits and hares. The Queen of Poland once took her on a
hunting excursion, and much amusement she afforded to the royal
party. She would discover game with the shrewdness of a bird of
prey, and having outrun and captured a hare, she would bring it with
great eagerness to the astonished and delighted queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was once set at the table with some people of rank, at a banquet.
She seemed delighted with the bright costumes, and the wit and
gay spirits of the guests. Presently she was gone. She returned at last
with something very choice in her apron, and with a face beaming with
happiness, she approached a fine lady, and holding up a live frog by
the leg said gleefully, &lsquo;Have some?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She dropped the frog into the plate of the startled guest, and
passing around the table, with a liberal supply of the reptiles, said,
&lsquo;Have some? have some?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ladies started back from such a dessert, and the poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
girl felt a pang of disappointment at the sudden rejection of the
offering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had gathered the frogs from a pond near at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a long time before she became accustomed to the habits of
civilization. She died in a convent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a strange history!&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn. &ldquo;She must have
found her life in the convent very different from that of her childhood.
What was her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They called her Maria le Blanc.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dct04"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Class stopped briefly at Calais, and was disappointed to
find a city so famous in history situated in a barren district,
and surrounded with little that is picturesque. The
old walls around the town are, however, pleasant promenades,
and command a view of the white cliffs of England. It was
here, after a siege of eleven months, that Eustace de St. Pierre and
his five companions offered themselves to Edward III. as a ransom
for the city, and were saved from death by the pleading of Queen
Philippa. The town was a fortress then, and looked menacingly over
to England. The English proudly held possession of it for more than
two hundred years, or from 1347 to 1558, when it was captured in
Bloody Mary&rsquo;s time by the French under the Duc de Guise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I am dead,&rdquo; said Mary in her last days, &ldquo;and my body is
opened, ye shall find <em>Calais</em> written on my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Calais recalls the stories of valor of the chivalrous campaigns of Edward
III. and his son, the Black Prince, in Normandy. At Crecy, the
Black Prince, when only sixteen years of age, led the English army to
victory, and slew the King of Bohemia with his own hand.</p>

<p>King Edward watched this battle from a windmill on a hill. The
French army was many times larger than the English. The Prince
during the battle found himself hard pressed, and at one point the
Earl of Warwick sent to the king for assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he is hard-pressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">CAPTURE OF KING JOHN AND HIS SON.</p>

<p>In 1356, in another campaign in Normandy, the Black Prince won a
most brilliant victory at Poitiers, and captured the French King John.
The latter was a brave soldier, and fought with his battle-axe until all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
the nobles had forsaken him. The Black Prince made a supper for
him in his tent in the evening, and waited upon him at the table with
his own hands. The Black Prince and the captive king rode through
London together, the former in great pomp, and the latter on a cream-colored
pony by his side. All of these things read prettily in history,
but one is glad that the time is past when war was the game of kings,
and armies were used as their playthings.</p>

<p>A series of easy rides near the cool sea brought the Class to the old
fishing village of &Eacute;tretat, now a fashionable summer resort for French
artists, and a popular bathing-place for those desiring seclusion amid
the coast scenery. It is situated amid rocks which the sea has excavated
into arches, aiguilles, and other fantastic recesses and caverns.
Its pretty ch&acirc;lets and villas on the hills, its gayly-dressed summer
idlers, its groups of fishermen who are to be seen in all weathers, its
handsome fisher girls bronzed by the sun who lead a free life by the
sea, its bathers in brilliant dresses of blue serge and bright trimmings,
its bracing air and usually fine weather, make it one of the quaintest
and most restful nooks in France.</p>

<p>There are the remains of a Norman church near the sea. It is said
to occupy the spot where the people watched the great flotilla of William
the Conqueror drift to St. Valery, there to take the Norman army
to England.</p>

<p>A French watering-place is quite different from an American seaside
resort. You have your board and sleeping-room in one of the hotels,
but your parlors, piazzas, and places of recreation are in an elegant
pleasure house, called the <em>Casino</em>. For the privileges of the Casino
you pay a small sum; at &Eacute;tretat it amounts to about ten dollars a
month. The billiard-rooms, ball-room, and the rooms for general conversation
are in the Casino.</p>

<p>Every one bathes in the sea at &Eacute;tretat, women and children, whole
families together, and most of the girls are expert swimmers. It is
delightful to sit upon the <em>shingle</em>, as the pebbly beach is called, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
watch the sport in the sun-bright mornings or golden and dreamy
afternoons. The costumes of the bathers are so pretty that the scene
seems like a ball in the sea. Bathing men are stationed here and
there to render any needed assistance.</p>

<p>The great caverns which the sea has worn in the rocks at &Eacute;tretat
remind one of the ruins of immense cathedrals, and are grand indeed
in the light of the full summer moon.</p>

<p>The place abounds with story-telling fishermen. The Class was
told one story here which is worthy of a poem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A beautiful stream once watered the valley. Its bed may still be
seen, but it now runs under ground. On the stream an industrious
miller built his mill and did a
thriving business. One day
a woman, sick and destitute,
came to him for help. He
turned heartlessly away from
her with abuse. The poor
creature raised her withered
arm, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To-morrow thou shalt
have thy reward.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the miller awoke
the next morning he found
his mill standing on dry
ground. The river had gone
down into the earth, where it
still runs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fisher&rsquo;s hymn which
Ernest Wynn gave the Club

for here by Master Lewis, and
was procured. It is sung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>

<p>The Class left &Eacute;tretat for Rouen.</p>


<p class="hrpad">&ldquo;O Rouen! Rouen! it is here I must die, and here shall be my last
resting-place!&rdquo; said Joan of Arc at the stake. Rouen was hardly the
resting-place of the heroic peasant girl, for her ashes were thrown into
the Seine. But the thought of the stranger on coming to Rouen is
less associated with its history under the sea-kings of the North, the
Norman dukes and the English invaders, than with the hard fate and
the public memorials of the simple shepherdess, who seems to have
been called from her flocks to change the destiny of France.</p>

<p>The Class entered Rouen after a series of short, zigzag journeys,
partly in coaches and partly on foot, going leisurely from town to town
through roads that presented to view continuous landscapes of shining
orchards, ripening gardens, and resplendent poppy-fields; stopping at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
Amiens, the birthplace of Peter the Hermit, meeting here and there a
ruin, and finding everywhere the connecting historical links between the
present and the past.</p>

<p>At Amiens the Class was brought into the presence of a relic which
greatly excited the boys&rsquo; wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This church,&rdquo; said their guide, taking the Class to a side chapel
of the cathedral, &ldquo;contains a very rare relic,&mdash;a part of the head of
John the Baptist!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Passing into the beautiful chapel the Class was shown the shrine
containing the precious treasure, which consists of the supposed frontal
bone, and the upper jaw of the saint.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de place</i> who accompanied the Class from the hotel seemed
to have no doubt of the genuineness of the relic, or of the propriety of
adoring it, if indeed it were real,&mdash;and he bowed reverently before the
shrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very rare relic,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;I did not know that such sacred remains
were anywhere to be found as are shown us in the churches of
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Quite</em> a rare relic,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, coolly. &ldquo;I believe that,
previous to the French Revolution, several whole heads of John the
Baptist were to be seen in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not think that a church like this would be guilty of imposture,
do you?&rdquo; asked Ernest Wynn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not wilfully. Most of these French relics were brought from
Constantinople at the time of the Crusades. They may be genuine,&mdash;the
people believe them so; but, in the absence of direct historic
evidence, it is probable that the Crusaders were deceived in them by
others, who in their turn may have been deceived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be shown wonderful relics or shrines supposed to contain
them, in nearly all the great churches of France. The French
people were taught their reverence for relics by St. Louis, who sought
to enrich the churches of his country with such treasures.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who was St. Louis?&rdquo; asked Ernest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have you ask the question,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.
&ldquo;His name meets you everywhere in France.</p>


<h3>STORY OF ST. LOUIS.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;St. Louis was one of the best men that ever sat on a throne.
But he was influenced by the superstitions of the times in which he
lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother was a most noble and pious woman, and he was a
dutiful and affectionate son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was regarded as very pious at this time for a prince to go on a
crusade. St. Louis was taken sick, and he made a vow that, if he recovered,
he would become a crusader. On his recovery, he appointed
his mother regent, and sailed with forty thousand men for Cyprus,
where he proceeded against Egypt, thinking by the conquest of that
country to open a triumphant way to Palestine. He was defeated, and
returned to France.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a model prince among his own people. He used to spend
a portion of each day in charity, and to feed an hundred or more
paupers every time he went to walk. He visited his own domestics
when they were sick; he founded charities, which have multiplied, and
to-day cause his name to be remembered with gratitude almost everywhere
in France. He made it the aim of his life to relieve suffering
wherever it might be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is related of him, among a multitude of stories, that he was once
accosted by a poor woman standing at the door of her cottage, who
held in her hand a loaf, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good king, it is of this bread that comes of thine alms that my
poor, sick husband is sustained.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king took the loaf and examined it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is rather hard bread,&rsquo; said he; and he then visited the sick man
himself and gave the case his personal sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
&ldquo;Going out on a certain Good Friday barefoot to distribute alms,
he saw a leper on the other side of a dirty pond. He waded through
it to the wretched man, gave him alms, then, taking his hand in his
own, kissed it. The act greatly astonished his attendants, but the disease
was not communicated to him.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">DEATH OF ST. LOUIS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1270 he started on a new crusade, but died in Tunis of the
pestilence. Visions of the conquest of the Holy City seemed to fill his
mind to the last. He was heard to exclaim on his death-bed in his
tent, &lsquo;Jerusalem! Jerusalem! We will go up to Jerusalem!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
One of the first places which the Class sought out in Rouen was
the statue of Joan of Arc. It is placed on a street fountain near the
spot where the unfortunate maid was burned. It disappointed our
tourists, and seemed an unworthy tribute to such an heroic character.
The great tower, called the Tower of Joan of Arc, seemed a more
fitting reminder of her achievements.</p>

<p>The streets of Rouen are narrow, but are full of life. Rouen has
been called a New Paris, and Napoleon said that Havre, Rouen, and
Paris were one city of which
the river Seine was the
highway. The gable-faced,
timber-fronted mansions
are interspersed with evidences
of modern thrift,
and the Rouen of romance
seems everywhere disappearing
in the Rouen of trade.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Rouen
is a confusing pile of art;
it has beautiful rose windows,
and its spire is four
hundred and thirty-six feet
high. The old church of
St. Ouen, which is larger
and more splendid than the
cathedral, is regarded as
one of the most perfect
specimens of Gothic art in
the world. It is 443 feet
long.</p>

or parliament house is called, is an odd but picturesque structure.
It lines three sides of a public square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, after a day of sight-seeing in
Rouen, &ldquo;we go to the most beautiful city in all the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew more about the history of Paris,&rdquo; said Ernest
Wynn, &ldquo;now that it is so near to us. I think of it as a place of gayety
and splendor, the scene of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Massacre, of the Revolution,
and the Commune. It was the city that Napoleon seemed to
love more than any thing else in the world. What is its early history?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will read in Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Commentaries, in your course in
Latin,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;a brief account of Lutetia, the chief town
of the Parisii, a Gallic tribe that the Romans conquered. This, I think,
is the oldest historical allusion to Paris, as Lutetia came to be called. It
was probably an old town at the time of the Roman invasion; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
chosen by Clovis as the seat of his empire in the sixth century; it began
to grow when the Northmen came sailing up the Seine in their
strange ships to its gates, and made it their prey. In the tenth century
it became the residence of Hugh Capet, the founder of the Capetian
line of kings, and soon after increased so rapidly that it doubled in size
and population. Under Henri of Navarre, in 1589, the city began to
be famous for its tendencies to gayety and splendor. Louis the Great
lavished the wealth of France upon it, converting the old ramparts into
picturesque public walks or boulevards, and enlarging and adorning its
palaces so that they rivalled the royal structures of the East. Then
Napoleon I. enriched it with the spoils of Europe, spending on it more
than &pound;4,000,000 in twelve years. Napoleon III. completed the work of
his predecessors by introducing into the city all modern improvements,
and making Paris in every respect the most magnificent capital in
Europe.</p>

<h3>STORY OF CHARLES IX. AND ST. BARTHOLOMEW&rsquo;S EVE.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Charles IX., the twelfth king of the family of Valois, came to the
French throne when only ten
years of age, under the regency
of his mother, that terrible woman,
Catharine de Medici. He
was an impulsive youth, restless
and vacillating, and was left
wholly to the evil influences of
his mother. The first years of
his reign were disturbed by the
struggles between the Protestant
and Catholic parties in
France. These difficulties were
apparently settled in 1569.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The queen-mother, who was
a Catholic, seemed to entertain
kind feelings towards the Protestant
leaders. The Protestant
King of Navarre was promised the hand of the king&rsquo;s sister Marguerite,
and marked courtesy and apparent kindness of feeling were shown
by the royal household to many of the leading men of the great
Protestant party. The latter were thus rendered unsuspicious of
danger, and became almost wholly disarmed.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">CATHARINE DE MEDICI.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Catharine de Medici, full of craft and wickedness, had resolved
to destroy the Protestant power. She was fully versed in crime, and
the passion for dark deeds grew upon her with years. One day she
went to the boy-king, Charles, and disclosed a plot for the massacre of
the Protestants of France. He listened with a feeling of horror. He
had learned to love the Protestant statesmen, and to call their great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
leader, Coligny, &lsquo;father.&rsquo; His young heart recoiled from such a deed.
But his mother gave him no rest. She confided her plot to the Catholic
leaders, who joined hand in hand with her to accomplish the crime.
Church and State united to persuade the young king that the stability
of the throne, the glory of his family, and the advancement of religious
truth demanded the slaughter of the Huguenots, as the Protestant
party were called. Still he hesitated; but after a little while exhibited
his characteristic weakness under the influence of persuasion, and the
conspirators knew his final assent was certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day was at hand, the time appointed by the
Catholic leaders, the Guises, for the work of death. Paris was full of
Huguenots from the principal provincial cities, who had been drawn
hither by the magnificent wedding of the Protestant King of Navarre.
The preparations for the massacre were nearly complete, but the young
king still hesitated to issue the fatal order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His mother now used every art in her power to make him place
himself boldly with the Guises. As he was king, she wished the sanction
of a royal edict to do her bloody work. With this the preparations
for the destruction of the Huguenots would be complete. Her appeals
at length so wrought upon his mind that he excitedly exclaimed,
&lsquo;Well, then, kill them! kill them all, that not a single Huguenot may
live to reproach me!&rsquo; This frantic remark was construed as an order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The massacre was appointed to begin on St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Eve,
at the tolling of a bell. The young king was fearfully nervous and
agitated during the preceding day. Just before the fatal hour, his conscience
had so affected his better feelings, that he despatched orders to
the Duc de Guise, countermanding the slaughter. The duke received
the message as he was in the act of mounting his horse to lead
the assassins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est trop tard!</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;It is too late!&rsquo; said the duke to the bearer,
and at once rode away.</p>

<p class="caption">COLIGNY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a still night, August 24, 1572. The defenceless Huguenots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"><!-- original location of 'Coligny' --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
were unsuspicious of danger, while armed assassins were lurking
in every house. At last the heavy clang of a great bell fell on the
breathless evening air, and the slaughter began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that summer night the streets ran with blood. The young
and the old, the daughter, the mother, the nobleman and the beggar,&mdash;all
who bore the name of Huguenot,&mdash;were cut off without mercy.
None were spared. Even women murdered women, and children, it is
said, impelled by the maddening example, applied the dagger to other
children in their beds. The streets of Paris ran with blood. From
thirty to seventy thousand persons were slain in the city and in the
towns of France on this night and a few days following it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new Queen of Navarre, Marguerite de Valois, had gone to
bed on the fatal eve, by the express order of Catharine. Just as she
was going to sleep, she says, a man knocked with hands and feet at
her door, shouting &lsquo;Navarre! Navarre!&rsquo; The nurse, thinking it was
the king, opened the door. A Protestant gentleman, bleeding, and
pursued by four archers, threw himself on her bed for protection. The
archers rushed after him, but were stayed by the appearance of the
captain of the guard. The young queen hid the wounded Huguenot
in one of her closets, and cared for him until he was able to escape.
Such scenes took place in nearly all the houses of the nobility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coligny was rudely murdered, and his body thrown out of the window
of his apartments into the courtyard, where it is said to have been
kicked by the Duc de Guise. The young king was in a court of the
palace of the Louvre, with his mother, when the great bell began to toll.
At first he trembled with fear and horror. He recovered presently
from his fear, and, running to the palace window, became so excited at
the sight of blood that he fired upon the wretched fugitives who were
attempting to escape by swimming across the Seine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the young king never knew a happy hour after that dreadful
night. He grew pale and thin, and his tortured conscience and shattered
brain called up in his solitary hours the images of the slain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
&ldquo;Two years after the massacre of St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Eve the young
king lay dying. His disease, it has been said, was caused by poison,
which had been applied to the leaves of one of his favorite books for
the purpose, by his unnatural mother. His sufferings were dreadful in
the extreme. Historians tell us that he sweat drops of blood. His
mental anguish was as fearful as his bodily distress. He would cry
out to his nurse, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, nourrice, ma mie, ma bonne! que du sang, que
d&rsquo;assassinats! Oh quels mauvais conseils j&rsquo;ai suivis! Oh Seigneur
Dieu, pardonnez moi, et faites moi misericorde!</i>&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah, nurse, my good
nurse! What blood! What murders! Oh what bad counsels I followed!
Lord God, pardon me! Have mercy on me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Historians cover the memory of Charles IX. with infamy, but his
first impulses were usually kind, and his first intentions good. He
does not seem to have inherited the disposition of that monster of wickedness,
his mother. His most evil acts could hardly be called his own.
Left to himself he would have been deemed a most polished and amiable
prince, though wanting in decision. As a victim of bad counsellors,
pity should mingle with the censure that follows his name.&rdquo;</p>

patriotism are everywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the ruins caused by the siege and the Commune?&rdquo;
asked Frank Gray, after the Class had been driven through a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
of streets. &ldquo;I do not see the first sign of there having been a recent
war and revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the fall of 1870,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;shot and shell for a long
period fell around the city and into it like rain. In the following
spring the Commune was declared the government of Paris, and it
seemed bent on destroying the city&rsquo;s beauty, and overturning its monuments
of art. The Vend&ocirc;me Column, which celebrated the victories
of Napoleon the Great, was pulled down as a monument of tyranny;
the Palace of the Tuileries and the Hotel de Ville were set on fire;
and the wealthy citizens who had endured the siege by a foreign foe
fled from their own countrymen. To-day most of the houses destroyed
by the war and the Commune are rebuilt, and the streets are as splendid
as in the gay days of the Empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Class took rooms in the <em>Grand Hotel</em>, one of the largest and
finest houses for public entertainment in Europe. Its first visit was
to the ancient Cathedral of Notre Dame, whose history is as old as
Christianity in France, and which even before that period was a Pagan
temple. Here <i>Te Deums</i> for all of the nation&rsquo;s victories have been
sung; funeral orations of kings have been pronounced, confessions of
sin for a thousand years have been made, and masses innumerable celebrated.
Here Napoleon the Great was crowned, and Napoleon III.
was married. Here the Goddess of Reason, after being borne through
the streets in state, was enthroned during the Revolution of 1793. It
has thirty-seven chapels.</p>

<p>In entering the cathedral the Class seemed to be in a new world.
The rose-colored windows flooded the edifice with a soft light; and
beyond it was a blaze of candles amid clouds of incense, for the priests
in their gorgeous vestments were administering at the altar.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE GODDESS OF REASON CARRIED THROUGH THE STREETS OF PARIS.</p>

<p>The boys passed through the waves of light reverently, and stood
near the altar. A choir of altar boys suddenly rose amid the smoke
and lights and glitter of priestly robes, and sang most melodiously. It
seemed very solemn and grand, but the thought of the associations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"><!-- original location of 'The Goddess of Reason' --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
the place was even more awe-inspiring. The scene was one that had
been enacted for more than a thousand years, under the groined roof of
the same stately edifice, and the past seemed to hang, a weight of gloom,
in the very air.</p>

<p>On each one&rsquo;s paying half a franc, the Class was admitted into the
sacristy, where the sacred relics, purchased in the East by St. Louis
himself, are kept. Among them is a supposed piece of the true cross
and a pretended part of the Crown of Thorns which was put upon the
Saviour&rsquo;s head before the Crucifixion.</p>

<p>The second day that the Class spent in Paris was the most delightful
of the whole tour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go with you to-day,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;to the most beautiful
place in Europe, the most beautiful garden in Europe, and one of
the most beautiful picture-galleries in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tuileries?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Louvre?&rdquo; asked Ernest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Tuileries and the Louvre are now one. Francis I. began the
building of the Louvre in 1541; Catharine de Medici commenced the
Tuileries in 1564; Napoleon III. united the two palaces in the four
years following 1852. The two palaces have been growing about three
hundred years. The Tuileries was partly burned by the Commune.
The united palaces cover twenty-four acres. Think of it! Twenty-four
acres of art, ornament, pictures, and splendor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The garden of the Tuileries is the favorite promenade of wealthy
and fashionable Parisians, and seemed to the boys too beautiful for
reality. Graceful statues rise on every hand from flower-beds, bowers,
by cool fountains, and in the shade of grand old trees,&mdash;statues in marble,
stone, and bronze; Grecian, Roman, French. Airy terraces, basins
bordered with rich foliage and gorgeous flowers carry the eye hither
and thither, and call out some new expression of admiration at almost
every step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
&ldquo;How happy the life of a French king must have been!&rdquo; said
Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How unhappy the lives of French kings have been!&rdquo; said Master
Lewis. &ldquo;If you would have a view of royalty that makes a peasant&rsquo;s
life seem desirable, read the history of the old French kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beautiful forests of France extend to the very outskirts of the
city. One of these, the Bois de Boulogne, is the favorite park of Paris.
It contains more than two thousand acres. It has an immense aquarium,
pavilions of birds, and a garden for ostriches and cassowaries,
and its principal avenue is one hundred yards wide.</p>

<p>The Class visited this park on a beautiful afternoon, passing through
the Champs Elys&eacute;es, a splendid avenue filled with equipages. In this
walk the boys saw the famous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arc de Triomphe</i> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Palais de
l&rsquo;Industrie</i>, in which the World&rsquo;s Fair was held in 1855, when nearly
two million strangers beheld Paris in her glory. The Arc de Triomphe
was begun in 1806, the year of the battle of Austerlitz, and was finished
by Louis Philippe. It commemorates the victories of Napoleon,
and is the most magnificent imperial monument in the world.</p>

<p>No scene in Paris seemed to inspire a part of the Class with so much
awe as the tomb of Napoleon. At the entrance to the crypt of the
dome of the church of the Invalides, containing the conqueror&rsquo;s
remains, are these words: &ldquo;I desire that my ashes may rest on the
banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people whom I have
loved so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a balustrade above the tomb under the beautiful dome the
boys looked down in silence on the sarcophagus, or stone coffin, which
is of Finland granite. The monolith on which it rests is porphyry, and
weighs 130,000 pounds. The monument cost nine million francs.</p>

<p>A beautifully tinted light fell upon the sarcophagus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>An armed guard approached, with a solemn gesture of the hand.
He simply said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be reverent.&rdquo;</p>

The delightful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de la Concorde</i>, which is between the Garden of
the Tuileries and the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and which has been called the
most delightful spot in any European city, had been passed through
by the Class in their walk to the park, and it was decided to give an
afternoon to a visit to it. Here stands the obelisk of Luxor, brought
from the ruins of Thebes.</p>

Two beautiful fountains were playing on the afternoon when the
Class made their visit. The sky was all rose and gold; the Seine flowed
calmly along; the aspect of every thing seemed as foreign to any past
association of war, tragedy, and pangs of human suffering as the
figures of the Tritons and Nereids that were spouting water from the
fishes in their hands.</p>

<p>Leaving the Place de la Concorde, which Master Lewis said he
believed was constructed in part of stones of the old Bastile, the Class
went to the public square where the Bastile had stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Place of the Bastile,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;now adorned by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
the Column of Liberty, is the site of the old Castle of Paris, which was
built as a defence against the English. The castle became a prison
for people who offended the French kings. The Man of the Iron
Mask was confined here. It was regarded as an obstacle to liberty, and
it was stormed by the people during the Revolution, and destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the Man of the Iron Mask?&rdquo; asked Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a question that used to be asked by all the statesmen of
Europe, and that has been repeated and always will be by every
reader of history. It has been answered in many different ways.
Books, pamphlets, and essays have been written upon the subject. It
is still a secret, and seems destined always to remain so. I will give
you briefly the strange history of this State prisoner.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>THE MAN OF THE IRON MASK.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;During the reign of that voluptuous old monarch, Louis XIV. of
France, there appeared on one of the Marguerite Islands, in the
Mediterranean, a prisoner of State closely guarded, and entrusted
to the especial care of a French governmental officer, De Saint
Mars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although confined in this obscure spot in the sea, where but little
was seen or heard save a distant sail and the dashing of waters, he
became a marked man among the few who chanced to meet him, and
the circumstance of his concealment was in danger of being noised
abroad. He was consequently removed to Paris, and immured in the
cells of the Bastile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the time that he began to attract attention on the island in
the Mediterranean to the close of his protracted life, no one but his
appointed attendants is known to have seen his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His head was enveloped in a black-velvet mask, confined by
springs of steel, and so arranged that he could not reveal his features
without immediate detection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">MAN OF THE IRON MASK.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
&ldquo;His guardian, De Saint Mars, had been instructed by a royal
order, or by an order from certain of the king&rsquo;s favorites, to take his
life immediately, should he attempt to reveal his identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During his confinement on the Marguerite island, De Saint Mars
ate and slept in the same room with him, and was always provided with
weapons with which to despatch him, should he attempt to discover
the secret of his history. If report is true, De Saint Mars might well
exercise caution, for it is asserted that he was to forfeit his own life if
by any want of watchfulness he allowed the prisoner to reveal his
identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prisoner himself seemed anxious to make the forbidden discovery.
He once wrote a word on some linen, and succeeded in communicating
what he wished to an individual not in the secret of the
mystery. But the <em>ruse</em> was discovered, and the person that received
the linen died suddenly, being taken off, it was supposed, by poison.
He once engraved something, probably his name, on a piece of silver
plate. The person to whom it was conveyed was detected in his
knowledge of the secret, and soon after died, as suddenly and mysteriously
as the one who had received the linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These incidents indicate that the prisoner was a man of shrewdness
and learning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was attended, during his imprisonment in the Bastile, by the
governor of the fortress, who alone administered to his wants; and
when he attended mass he was always followed by a detachment of
invalides (French soldiers), who were instructed to fire upon him in
case he should speak or attempt to uncover his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These circumstances, and many others of like character, show that
he was a person of very eminent rank, and that those who thus shut
him out from mankind were conscious that they were committing a
crime of no ordinary magnitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, then, was this person of mystery, familiarly known as the
Man of the Iron Mask?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
&ldquo;He is supposed by many to have been a son of Anne of Austria
and the Duke of Buckingham, and consequently a half-brother of
Louis XIV., and a co-heir to the throne of France. If so, it would
appear, that, while Louis XIV. was luxuriating amid the splendors of
the palace of Versailles, his brother was suffering the miseries of exile,
or languishing in a dungeon, shut out not only from the outward
world, but from all intercourse with mankind. But other writers think
him to have been some less remarkable person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The iron mask, of which frequent mention has been made in
sensational books, was a very simple contrivance of velvet and springs
of steel.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpad">The Class made two excursions from Paris, one to Versailles and
the other to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Versailles, a town of 30,000 inhabitants, which has grown up around
one of the finest palaces and parks of Europe, was originally the hunting-lodge
of Louis XIII. Louis XIV. chose the place for a palace,
and employed almost an army of men for eleven years upon the structure.
He spent upon this palace nearly &pound;40,000,000 sterling. Thither
in 1680 he removed his gay court, and here he passed in gloomy
grandeur his melancholy old age.</p>

<p>It is a place of beautiful gardens, wonderful fountains, fine statues,
and walks associated with the history of kings, queens, statesmen, and
scholars. The palace to the visitor seems a vast picture gallery,
wherein is shown the conquests of France. It is a long journey
through the glittering rooms. Here you see the representation of
a king in his moment of triumph, adored as a god, and there you see
the same king overthrown or stretched upon his bed of death. The
fountains murmur, the orange trees fill the air with perfume, and
you turn from the exhibition of the glowing and faded pomps of history
to the gardens, feeling that after all man&rsquo;s only nobility and kingship
and hope of a crown lies in his soul, and it is virtue alone that
makes one royal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
Two small palaces or villas in the Park of Versailles, called Great
Trianon and Little Trianon, recalled to Master Lewis the happy days
of the life of Marie Antoinette, which she spent here while the unseen
cloud of the Revolution was gathering, and the calm settled down on
Paris before the storm.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE DAUPHIN.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;He was born at Versailles in 1785. He was a most affectionate
child, and was ardently attached to his mother. He used to sport about
the gardens of the palace; the very place where we are now was his
play-ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would sometimes rise early in the morning to gather flowers
from the gardens to lay on his mother&rsquo;s pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; he would say, when weary of play, &lsquo;I have not earned the
first kiss from mother to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Revolution came and cast a shadow over Versailles, with all
its glory. The royal family was surrounded with enemies, and was
in constant terror, and the little dauphin was made unhappy by the
sight of his mother&rsquo;s tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day a serving-woman told him that if he would procure some
favor for her she would be happy as a queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As happy as a queen!&rsquo; he answered: &lsquo;I know of one queen who
does nothing but weep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Revolutionists overthrew the Bastile and the throne, and the
members of the royal family were obliged to seek protection in the
National Assembly. They were then confined in an old French prison,
called the Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king was tried by the Assembly, was condemned and executed.
He deeply loved the dauphin, and parted from him with bitter
grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the king&rsquo;s death the dauphin was the principal solace of
the queen in her imprisonment. He was at last removed from the
queen&rsquo;s apartment by an order of the Committee of Public Safety. It
is related that when the guards came to take him away, his mother
fought for him until her strength was exhausted, and she fell senseless
upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the execution of his mother he was given over to the care
of a brutal shoemaker, named Simon, who endeavored to cause his
death without committing palpable murder. He was ill-fed, beaten
and abused, and received the name of the &lsquo;She-wolf&rsquo;s Whelp,&rsquo; referring
to Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this period the police were in the habit of distributing in the
streets songs against &lsquo;Madame Veto,&rsquo; as the queen had been called.
One of the most infamous of these, as vulgar as it was brutal, had been
preserved by Simon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, for the want of a new torture for the child, Simon
resolved to make him sing this obscene song against his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Come along, Capet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;here is a new song which you
must sing to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He handed the song to the dauphin. The boy saw its meaning,
and with all the instincts of a susceptible nature he recoiled from the
thought of reviling his mother. He laid it down on the table without
saying a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon arose in wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought I said you must sing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never will sing such a song.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I declare to you that I will kill you if you refuse to obey me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simon caught up an andiron, and threw it at the child with a
force that would have proved fatal had he not missed his aim. His
passion then gradually subsided, but the boy refused to sing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, after a system of abuses too shocking to relate, Simon
seized the dauphin by the ear, and drawing him to the middle of the
apartment, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Capet, if the Vend&eacute;ans were to set you at liberty, what would
you do to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would forgive you,&rsquo; replied the noble boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His situation at last became wretched in the extreme. He was
placed in a filthy cell where he could neither receive pure air nor have
exercise; his food was scanty, his bed was not made for six months,
and his clothes were not changed for a year. He became covered with
vermin, and the mice used to nibble at his feet. He passed the days
in utter silence, wishing only to die. Once, when he had attempted to
pray kneeling, he had been discovered and terribly punished, and he
felt that it was not safe for him to speak even to his God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the overthrow of the Revolutionary government under
Robespierre, he was assigned to more merciful keepers. But his body
and mind were in ruins, and all efforts to restore him proved in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a lovely June day in the summer of 1795. He was dying;
without, the air was full of sunshine, of birds and roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you in pain?&rsquo; asked his attendant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but not in so much as I was, the music is so
sweet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He presently added; &lsquo;Do you not hear the music?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From whence does it come?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From above.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His eyes became luminous; he seemed happy and peaceful, and
he fancied that among the voices that seemed to be singing around
him he could distinguish that of his mother. It may have been all
but a dream or fancy, but it grew out of the filial devotion of his
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">FOREST OF FONTAINEBLEAU.</p>

<p>Fontainebleau is one of the most ancient palaces of France; it is a
labyrinth of galleries, salons, amphitheatres, secret chambers, and fantastic
balconies. To traverse the palace is a journey. Like all the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
French palaces, it is surrounded with gardens, parks, and has its wood
or forest. Indeed, the town of Fontainebleau is situated in a forest,
which covers an extent of sixty-four miles.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">IN THE WOOD AT FONTAINEBLEAU.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artists, poets, romancers, and lovers,&rdquo; says a writer, &ldquo;have from
time immemorial made the forest of Fontainebleau the empire of their
dreams. You ought to see it in the morning, when the bird sings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
when the sun shines, ... when all these stones, heaped beneath those
aged trees, take a thousand fantastic forms, and give to it the appearance
of the plain on which the Titans fought against Heaven. Oh,
what terrible and touching histories, stories of hunting and of love, of
treason and vengeance, this forest has covered with its shadow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>St. Louis loved this forest, and Napoleon signed his abdication at
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Master Lewis had allowed the boys to have a day to themselves in
each of the principal places where they had stopped. If one of them
wished to make an excursion on that day to some neighboring place,
the good teacher made some careful arrangement for that one to do so.
He was very careful about all matters of this kind, without really seeming
to distrust the boys&rsquo; judgment in their efforts to look out for themselves.
A coach-driver, a traveller, a valet-de-place, or some person
was usually employed to have an eye on the member of the Class who
was allowed to make a tour to a strange place alone.</p>

<p>The boys, with the exception of Tommy Toby, were given a day to
go where they liked in Paris. Master Lewis did not dare to allow
Tommy this privilege, after his misadventure in England.</p>

<p>The Wynns visited the Palace of the Institute; Frank Gray, the
Grand Opera House.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to go to the river this morning,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;and
sail on the &mdash;&mdash; queer boats there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flies, or water-omnibuses?&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;I will go
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy looked surprised and hardly seemed pleased, not that he did
not generally like Master Lewis&rsquo;s company, but because it looked to
him like a restraint upon his freedom.</p>

<p>But the good teacher took his hat and cane, and Tommy did not
express any displeasure in words. The two went to a splendid stone
bridge called the Pont d&rsquo;Jena, over the Seine.</p>

<p>Compared with the Mississippi, the Ohio, or the St. Lawrence, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
Seine is but a small stream. The river is lined with solid stone-work on
each side, and its banks are shaded with trees. It is filled with queer
crafts, and a multitude of families live on the barges that convey wood,
coal, and certain kinds of merchandise from place to place.</p>

<p>As Master Lewis and Tommy were standing on the bridge, watching
the sloops as they lowered their masts to pass under, an astonishing
sight met Tommy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>It was a great boat, like a steamer, but without screw or paddles,
swiftly passing up the river by means of a chain which rose out of the
water at the bows, ran along the deck, turned around wheels which
seemed to be worked by an engine, and then slipped overboard at the
stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far can that boat go on in that way?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The chain by which the boat is carried forward,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis, &ldquo;is <em>one hundred miles long</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Lewis and Tommy passed some hours among the queer
crafts on the river, taking passages here and there on the flies or water-omnibuses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you afraid to trust me alone this morning?&rdquo; asked Tommy,
on their return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think I could not speak French well enough to go out
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your French might not be very well understood here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can talk simple French, such as servants could understand
very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the afternoon, being somewhat alone, Tommy thought he would
explore the hotel, which was something of a town in itself. He
descended from his apartment on the third floor, with the intention of
going to the courtyard. But he could not find the place which had so
attracted him from his window. He tried to go back, but lost the way
even to his apartment. He descended again, but failed to find any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
place he remembered to have seen before. It was all as grand as a
palace, but as puzzling as a labyrinth he had seen in the grounds of
Hampton Court Palace.</p>

<p>He said to one after another of the very polite people he chanced
to meet,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir [or madam], do you speak English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He received only smiles of good-will, and courteous shakes of the
head, in answer to all inquiries.</p>

<p>Tommy remembered his French lessons. Happy thought! He
accosted a servant, whose knowledge of the language he fancied might
be as simple as his own:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pardon, Monsieur, voulez-vous avez la
bont&eacute; de m&rsquo;indiquer un valet-de-place?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne comprends pas</i>,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne comprends pas</i>,&rdquo; said Tommy.
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne puis pas trouver ma chambre</i>,&rdquo;
pointing upward. &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voulez-vous m&rsquo;indiquer
quelqu&rsquo;un qui parle l&rsquo;Anglais?</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne comprends pas.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ne comprenez-vous Fran&ccedil;ais?</i>&rdquo; said
Tommy.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s face wore a willing, but very
puzzled expression.</p>

<p>Just then a girl with a happy face came
out of one of the rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you speak&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course I speak. I
am very glad to meet you here. How
pleasant!&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;JE NE COMPRENDS PAS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Agnes, the young lady who had made herself so agreeable on
the steamer.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a chat with Agnes, Master Lewis said to
Tommy,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think I will let you take a day to go where you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not let me go with you?&rdquo; asked Agnes. &ldquo;It is a f&ecirc;te
day, or some kind of Church festival, and I would like to go to that
lovely church of St. Eustache, where they have the finest organ and
sweetest chanting in the world. I know you will like it. It took a
hundred years to build the church. It is all just like fairy-land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Agnes had been reading the comedies of Moli&egrave;re, the French
Shakspeare, she induced Tommy to attend her to the old Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Fran&ccedil;ais, which was under the direction of the great dramatist for
many years, and where he was stricken down by death in the middle of
a play. It was not open for an exhibition at the hour of the visit, but a
courteous Frenchman took them through it, and related to Agnes
some pleasing anecdotes of Moli&egrave;re.</p>

<p>The Class took many delightful walks along the clean streets and
charming boulevards, visiting churches, public buildings, statues, and
paintings. In one of the visits to a church Tommy was much amused
by a priest who, as the people were going out
after some superb music, pretended to be praying,
but who, amid the noise and confusion,
was only making contortions of his face.
Tommy went through the priest&rsquo;s performance
in dumb show when he returned to the hotel,
for the amusement of Agnes, but was checked
by Master Lewis when he attempted a similar
imitation in one of the public rooms, lest
some one might mistake it for a want of
reverence for sacred things.</p>

<img src="images/zje123.jpg" width="177" height="200"
alt="The priest pretending to pray" />
</div>

<p>In one of these walks they were shown a place where a French boy
did a noble act at the end of the last war.</p>

<p>An order had been issued to shoot all persons found with arms in
their hands in the streets. A captain with his company on duty came
upon a French boy with a musket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
&ldquo;I must order your execution,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me return a watch I have borrowed,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will you return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At once, upon my word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy went away, and the captain never expected to see him
again. But he presently came back, and taking a heroic attitude said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I am ready. Fire!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was pardoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young French people,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;are very patriotic.
History abounds with noble acts of French boys. I will relate an incident
or two to the point:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph Barra lived in the interior of France at the beginning of
the French Revolution. He was a generous-hearted boy, who loved
truth, his mother, and his country. He was a Republican at heart; a
boy of his impulses could have been nothing else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wishing to serve his country in the great struggle for liberty, he
entered the Republican army at the age of twelve, as a drummer boy.
His whole soul entered into the cause; he was ready to endure any
hardship and to make any sacrifice, that the country he loved might be
free. He allowed himself no luxuries, but he sent the whole of his pay
as a musician to his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His regiment was ordered to La Vend&eacute;e to encounter a body of
Royalists. One day he found himself cut off from the troops, and
surrounded by a party of Royalists. Twenty bayonets were pointed
towards his breast. He stood, calm and unflinching, before the glittering
steel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shout,&rsquo; cried the leader of the Royalists, &lsquo;shout, &ldquo;Long live
Louis XVII!&rdquo; or die!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twenty bayonets were pushed forward within an inch of his
body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He bent upon his captors a steady eye, kindling with the lofty
purpose of his soul. He took off his hat. He gazed for a moment on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
the blue sky and the green earth. Then, waving his hand aloft, he
exclaimed, &lsquo;<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la R&eacute;publique!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The twenty bayonets did their cruel work, and the boy died, a
martyr to his convictions of right and of liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph Agricole Vialla, a boy thirteen years of age, connected
himself with a party of French Republican soldiers stationed on the
Danube. One day an army of insurgent Royalists were discovered on
the opposite side of the river, attempting to cross over on a pontoon.
The only safety for the Republican soldiers was to cut the cables that
held the bridge to the shore. Whoever should attempt to do this
would fall within range of the Royalists&rsquo; guns, and would be exposed to
what seemed to be certain destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would volunteer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every soldier hesitated. The boy Vialla seized an axe, and ran
to the bank of the stream. He began to cut the cables amid frequent
volleys of shot from the other side, when a ball entered his breast. He
fell, but raising himself for a moment, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I die, but I die for my fatherland!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chant du D&eacute;part</i>&mdash;an old French revolutionary song, once
almost as famous as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>&mdash;the deeds of these boy-heroes
are celebrated in the following strain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;O Barra! Vialla! we envy your glory.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still victors, though breathless ye lie.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
Wyllys Wynn seemed much impressed by these incidents of youthful
heroism. He sometimes wrote poems, and on his return to the
hotel he related the incident of the boy and the watch in these lines,
which he read in one of the parlors to Agnes.</p>

<p><span class="dct04"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Class went by rail
from Paris to the
bright Norman district
of Calvados, visiting
Caen and Bayeux, whose
attractions have been briefly
sketched in the letter of George
Howe to Master Lewis. The
next journey was to Avranches,
or the &ldquo;Village of the Cliff,&rdquo; by
the way of Falaise, the residence
of Duke Robert, father
of William the Conqueror, and to
the quaint town of Vire, famous
for its cleanly, industrious inhabitants
its grand old hills
buried in woods, its great wayside
trees, and its ancient clock-tower.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 270px;">

<img src="images/zje124.jpg" width="270" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">CLOCK TOWER AT VIRE.</p>

<p>The Class met few people on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
this journey. The cantonniers were evidently busy with their own
simple industries. Once or twice the boys saw gentlemen, whom
Master Lewis said were cur&eacute;s, at work in cool, green gardens; and
often they met the pretty sight of women and girls at work in the fields.
The cottages were thatched, and some were moss-grown, and all the
canton wore the appearance of simple contentment, virtue, and thrift.</p>

<p>Avranches is a favorite summer resort for English tourists, owing
to the beauty of its situation, its health-giving air, and the ease and
cheapness with which one may live.</p>

<p>The journey from Caen, along the bowery Norman highways, was
made in diligences. The boys seemed to brim over with pleasure at
the prospect of a ride in a diligence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one place where contentment and happiness may surely
be found,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby, one day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the top of a diligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day the Class was overtaken, while travelling in the
French coach, by a pouring rain. Tommy, as usual, was on the seat
with the driver. He became very impatient, saying, every few minutes,
&ldquo;I wish it would stop raining, I wish&mdash;&rdquo; this, that, and the other
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, from within the coach, &ldquo;are you
<em>sure</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time the sunlight overspread the landscape, making the
watery leaves shine like the multitudinous wavelets of the sea.</p>

<p>Tommy&rsquo;s merry voice was heard again, talking bad French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Contentment and happiness,&rdquo; said Master Lewis to Frank, &ldquo;have
evidently returned again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Avranches the Class visited that wonderful castle, church, and
village of the sea, Mont St. Michel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
The journey from the mainland was by a tramway across the Gr&egrave;ve,
or sands, at low tide. At neap tides the Mount is not surrounded by
water at any time, but at spring tides it is washed by the sea twice a
day, and sometimes seems like a partly sunken hill in the sea. The
fortress is girt about the base with feudal walls and towers colored by
the sea; above these rises a little town, the houses being set on broken
ledges of rock; above the town stand the fortifications, and a church
and its tower crown all. It is one of the most curious places in the
world.</p>

<p>Pagan priests here worshipped the god of high places; monks
succeeded them; Henry II held court here, then it became a place to
which saints made yearly pilgrimages. The Revolution drove out the
monks, and turned it into a prison. In an iron cage called the Cage
of St. Michel, a torturous contrivance, state prisoners used to be confined.</p>

<p>The Class next went to St. Malo, by the way of Dol; a breezy
journey, with the sea in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Malo,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;was the birthplace of Chateaubriand,
who visited our country after the American Revolution, and in
1801 wrote an Indian romance, &lsquo;Atala,&rsquo; a prose Hiawatha, if I may so
call it, which charmed all Europe. He published a political work on
America, which had great influence in France. He was in early life a
sceptic, but the memory of a good mother made him a Christian, and
he published a book on religion which arrested the infidel tendencies
of the times. Louis XVIII. declared that one of his pamphlets was
worth an army of one hundred thousand men. He was one of the
most brilliant writers France ever produced. You should read on your
return &lsquo;Atala&rsquo; in French. You will find an edition, I think, illustrated
by Dor&eacute;, in which the pictures will compel you to read the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read &lsquo;Atala,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to visit Chateaubriand&rsquo;s birthplace with me?&rdquo;
asked Master Lewis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
Frank was very desirous to see the place at once, and Master Lewis
and he went to the house, now a hotel, immediately on their arrival in
the town. From the windows of the house could be seen the tomb of
Chateaubriand, which is on a little island in the harbor.</p>

<p>When Master Lewis returned to the hotel he was alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Frank?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is to spend the night in Chateaubriand&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis. &ldquo;Visitors at St. Malo are allowed to sleep there on paying a
small sum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Chateaubriand living yet?&rdquo; asked Tommy. &ldquo;I thought you
said he came to our country after the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he died many years ago. Frank and I have just been looking
from the windows of his birthplace at his tomb on one of the little
islands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Frank is not going to stay all night in the room of one that
is dead! What good will that do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the respect that appreciation pays to genius,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis.</p>

<p>Ernest Wynn wished to spend the night with Frank, and received
Master Lewis&rsquo;s permission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ernest!&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;I thought you had more sense.
I am glad I am not literary. This is the strangest thing I have met
with yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chateaubriand&rsquo;s birthplace is the Hotel de France. His room is
among those offered to visitors, at a little extra cost. Master Lewis
had stopped at the hotel during a previous tour.</p>

<p>If Tommy was surprised at the &ldquo;respect appreciation pays to genius,&rdquo;
in the incident of sleeping in Chateaubriand&rsquo;s room, he was
more so by a conversation which took place next day, when Master
Lewis made his plans for the last zigzag journeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last place we will visit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Nantes. We will go by
rail to Rennes, and by diligences the rest of the way, which will afford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
you a fine view of Brittany. At Rennes, we will make, if you like, a
d&eacute;tour to Vitr&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we see there?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The residence of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>she</em> living?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wrote letters to her daughter,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was her daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prettiest girl in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is <em>she</em> living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Frank, impatiently. &ldquo;Why, did you never hear of
the Letters of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never did. Are her letters there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The room where she wrote them,&rdquo; said Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be very wonderful letters, I should think,&rdquo; said Tommy,
&ldquo;to make a traveller take all that trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;Lord Macaulay says, &lsquo;Among
modern works I only know two perfect ones; they are Pascal&rsquo;s Provincial
Letters, and the Letters of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Class was now in Brittany, a province old and poor, whose
very charm is its simplicity and quaintness. Normandy smiles; Brittany
wears a sombre aspect everywhere. Normandy is a bed of flowers;
Brittany seems to be a bed of stone. Here and there may be seen
a church buried in greenery, but the landscape is one of heath, fern,
and broom.</p>

<p>The people are as peculiar as the country. Their costumes are odd,
some of them even wear goat-skins. Many of them lead a sea-faring
life; it is the Bretons who chiefly man the French navy.</p>

<p>They cling to old legends and superstitions with great fondness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
the wild country abounds with wonder-stories. Nearly all of these
stories are striking from their very improbability. They relate to an
imaginary period when the Apostles travelled in Brittany, or to men
and women who were transformed during some part of their lives into
animals, especially into wolves. The story-telling beggars furnish
much of the fiction to the unread people.</p>

<p>Those legends which are the chief favorites are undoubtedly very
old. The Class listened to several of them at their hotel at St. Malo.
Some of them begin in a way that at once arrests attention; as the
following story of the</p>


<h3>OLD WOMAN&rsquo;S COW.</h3>

<p>When St. Peter and St. John were visiting the poor in Brittany
they stopped one day to rest at a farm-house among the trees, where
they met a little old woman who kindly brought them a pitcher of cool
water.</p>

<p>After the saints had drunk, the old woman told them the story of
her hard life. She had seen better days, she said; her husband had
once owned a cow, but he had lost it, and he now was only a laborer
on the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take the stick in your hand,&rdquo; said St. Peter.</p>

<p>The saint struck the stick on the ground, and up came a fine cow
with udders full of milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy Virgin!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;What made that cow come up
from the ground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grace of God,&rdquo; said St. Peter.</p>

<p>When the saints had gone, the old woman wondered whether, if
she were to strike with the stick on the ground, another cow would
appear.</p>

<p>She struck the ground as she had seen St. Peter do, when up came
an enormous wolf and killed the cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
The old woman ran after the saints and told her alarming story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have been content,&rdquo; said St. Peter, &ldquo;with the cow the
Lord gave you. It shall be restored to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned back, and found the cow at the door, lowing to be
milked.</p>

<p>Another story, which greatly pleased Tommy is</p>


<h3>THE WONDERFUL SACK.</h3>

<p>St. Christopher was a ferry-man. He dwelt in Brittany, at Dol.
One day the Lord came to Dol, and wished to cross the river with the
twelve Apostles.</p>

<p>St. Christopher, instead of using a ferry-boat, carried the travellers
who came to him across the river on his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>When he had thus taken over the Lord and his Apostles, he claimed
his reward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you have?&rdquo; asked the Lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask for Paradise,&rdquo; said St. Peter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said St. Christopher; &ldquo;I ask that whatsoever I may desire
may at all times be put into my sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have your wish; but never desire money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day the Evil One came to St. Christopher, and tempted him
to wish for money.</p>

<p>They fell to fighting, and the fight lasted two whole days; but, just
as the Evil One seemed about to overcome the saint, the latter said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Lord, get into my sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment the Evil One was in the sack, and St. Christopher
tied the string, and took him to a blacksmith, and requested the use of
a hammer.</p>

<p>Then St. Christopher and the smith hammered the Evil One as
thin as a penny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I own I am <em>beaten</em>,&rdquo; said a voice from the sack. &ldquo;Now let me
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
&ldquo;On one condition,&rdquo; said the saint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you will never trouble me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ferry-man now began to lead a life of charity. He never
thought of himself, but lived wholly for others; and every one loved
him, and all that were in distress came to him for comfort.</p>

<p>One day he died, full of years, and, taking with him his wonderful
sack, he started for the gates of Paradise.</p>

<p>St. Peter opened the gate. But when he saw that the new-comer
was St. Christopher, who had slighted his counsel, he refused to admit
him.</p>

<p>The Celestial City, blazing in splendor, stood on the top of a high
mountain; the sound of music and the odors of flowers came through
the gate as it was opened, and the saint with a heavy heart turned
away from all the ravishing beauty, and, hardly knowing what he did,
went down the mountain, until he came to the gate of the region where
bad souls dwell.</p>

<p>A youth at the gate said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gate opened, and the Evil One saw him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut the gate! shut the gate!&rdquo; said the Evil One to the youth.</p>

<p>Far, far away the Holy City beamed with ineffable brightness, and
up the hill again with a still heavy heart went St. Christopher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only get my sack inside the gate, I could wish myself
into it; and once inside the gate I could never be turned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came up to the gate again, and called for St. Peter.</p>

<p>The saint opened the gate a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray you in charity,&rdquo; said St. Christopher, &ldquo;let me listen to the
music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gate was set a little more ajar. Immediately St. Christopher

moment he was in the sack himself,&mdash;and he has remained in the region
of light, music, flowers, and happiness ever since.</p>


<p class="hrpad">The Class went by rail to Rennes, one of the old capitals of Brittany.
It was hardly interesting to them, but a pleasant ride took
them to Vitr&eacute;, where the boys visited the residence of Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;.</p>

<p>Nantes, the ancient residence of the Dukes of Brittany, is situated
on the river Loire, about forty miles from the sea. It is one of the
largest and most beautiful of the provincial towns of France. In the
old castle Henry IV. signed the Edict of Nantes, giving freedom of
worship to the Protestants in France.</p>

<p>This famous Edict was published April 13, 1598. The Reformers,
or Huguenots, had at this time seven hundred and sixty churches. It
was revoked by Louis XIV. in 1685, under the influence of his prelates,
who persuaded him thus to seek expiation for his sins. The result
of the act was that four hundred thousand Protestants, who were
among the most industrious, intelligent, and useful people of France,
left the country rather than to give up their religion. They took
refuge in Great Britain, Holland, Prussia, Switzerland, and America.
From them these countries learned some of the finest French arts.</p>

<p>The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was one of the many acts
of injustice that opened the way for the French Revolution, by destroying
public virtue.</p>

<p>Some of the most terrible scenes of the Revolution were enacted at
Nantes.</p>

<p>One of the first visits made by the Class at Nantes was to the old
warehouse, called the Salorges, built as an entrepot for colonial merchandize,
which is associated with the inhuman murders of the Revolution.
Here the monster Carrier caused men and women to be tied
together and hurled into the Loire, making an exhibition of the cruelty
which was known as Republican Marriages. It was in front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
Salorges that executions by water, called Noyades, were performed.
Boats loaded with from twenty to forty victims were towed into the
middle of the river, and were sunk by means of trap-doors in their
sides, which were opened by cords communicating with the shore. If
any of these wretched people attempted to escape by swimming, they
were shot. As many as six hundred human beings perished in this
way in a single day. The whole number of persons thus destroyed
reached many thousands. Women and children were drowned as
well as men. The river became so full of bodies that the air was
made pestilent.</p>

<p>This was during the dark days of the Reign of Terror, when Marat
and Robespierre ruled France. Besides the victims of the Noyades
were those who perished in other merciless ways. Five hundred children
were shot in a single day, and were buried in trenches that had
been prepared for the purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wonder that Charlotte Corday, who killed Marat, should
have been regarded as a heroine,&rdquo; said Frank Gray. &ldquo;I cannot understand
how Frenchmen, who seem to be the most polite, obliging, kind-hearted,
people in the world, could have been led to do the bloody
deeds of the Reign of Terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because you have read history too much without thought.
In reading history always go back to the causes of things. Read backward
as well as forward. All the great palaces in France you have
seen were built by the money of an overtaxed people who had no
political rights. They were the glittering abodes of immorality. Again
and again France was governed by wicked women who became favorites
of the king. The Huguenots, who were the sincerely religious
people of France, were compelled to leave the nation. Think of it,&mdash;four
hundred thousand people going away from their native country
at the unrestrained edict of one bad man. Do you wonder the people
of France desired a Constitution for their protection? The nobler orders
of the Catholic Church, the Jansenists and Port Royalists as they

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
were called, were also suppressed. The Church became immoral,
tyrannical, and almost wholly corrupt, an enemy to the rights of the
people. The reaction against such a church, which violated all the precepts
of the Gospel, was infidelity.</p>

<p class="caption">F&Eacute;NELON AND THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the whole of the reign of Louis XV. the cloud of Revolution
was gathering. Louis saw it, but he was so given over to sensuality
that it little troubled him. &lsquo;These things will last as long as I
shall,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Apr&egrave;s nous le d&eacute;luge</i>&rsquo; (after us the deluge). He was
wholly governed, and the nation ruled, by Madame de Pompadour, a
corrupt and worthless woman, who made and dismissed ministers of
State and cardinals, declared war and dictated terms of peace. She
declared that even her lap-dog was weary of the fawnings of nobles.
Are you surprised that Frenchmen should rise against such a state of
things as this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was not Louis XV. educated by F&eacute;nelon, who wrote <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>,
the French text-book we have been studying?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the most corrupt king of France was educated by the purest
and most lovable man of genius that the times produced. The king
was a wilful child, but it was thought that F&eacute;nelon had quite changed
his character by his religious influence. He was subject to what were
called &lsquo;mad fits.&rsquo; I might tell you some pleasant stories of this period
of his life. One day, when F&eacute;nelon had reproved him for some grave
fault, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know what I am, and I know also what you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F&eacute;nelon&rsquo;s prudent conduct quite won back the affection of the
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will leave the Duke of Burgundy [his title] behind the door
when I am with you,&rsquo; he used to say, &lsquo;and I will be only little Louis.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F&eacute;nelon turned the boy&rsquo;s mind to piety, and for a time influenced
him by it. &lsquo;All his mad fits and spites,&rsquo; he said of his pupil, &lsquo;yielded
to the name of God.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But F&eacute;nelon, like all good and pure men of the time, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
condemned by the court and the Church. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>, written to train
the mind of the young prince in the principles of virtue, caused him to
lose favor with the court, and he spent the last years of his life in virtual
exile.</p>

vain. He was once ill, and on his recovery all Paris was filled with
rejoicing. An immense crowd gathered around the palace on the eve
of St. Louis&rsquo;s Day in honor of the convalescence. As the boy-king
stood on the balcony of the palace on the occasion, Marshal Villeroy
said to him,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look at all this company of people: all are yours; they all belong
to you; you are their master.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of a boy&rsquo;s being told that the people of Paris belonged to
him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can wonder at the Reign of Terror, but I cannot be surprised
at the Revolution when I view the history of France for the century
that preceded it. It is rather a matter of surprise that an enlightened
people should have submitted to tyranny so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nantes is the Paris of the Loire. Its streets, boulevards, public
squares, the forest of masts in the river, and the trees that line its
banks, all seem a copy of the bright and gay French capital. Its old
cathedral is a queer-looking building, with towers scarcely higher than
its roof; but it contains a most beautiful tomb which was erected in
memory of Francis II. last Duke of Bretagne. It is adorned with
figures of angels, the twelve Apostles, St. Louis, and Charlemagne.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting excursions made by the Class from
Nantes was to the ruin of the old castle of</p>


<h3>BLUE-BEARD.</h3>

<p>There existed, many centuries ago, a ferocious, cruel old lord, whose
treatment of his wives and ogre-like tyranny to all around him, gave
origin to the thrilling story of Blue-beard; indeed, the story was so
nearly true that this old lord was actually called &ldquo;Blue-beard&rdquo; by his
neighbors, so blue-black was his long and stubby beard.</p>

<p>He lived in the old days when barons were fierce and despotic, and
shut their wives and daughters up in dark dungeons or high castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
casements, and thought little more of ordering a score of peasants off
to instant execution than of eating their breakfasts.</p>

<p>He was a rich old fellow, and had several castles scattered about
the country, whither princes and dukes used to go and visit him, and
share in his hunting-parties in the wildwoods.</p>

<p>His castles were situated in the province of Brittany, and his real
name was one which is still to be found in these secluded regions,&mdash;the
Sieur Duval. The lapse of time has caused all his fine castles wholly
to disappear, with one exception, and it is that which I am about to
describe to you.</p>

<p>Sieur Duval had his favorite residence on the banks of a lovely
little river, about two miles from Nantes. Here he was near town, and
might ride in on one of his high-tempered chargers whenever he listed,
to join the revels of the dukes, or go wife-hunting.</p>

<p>It was at this castle that his cruelties to his unhappy spouses are
supposed to have occurred; and it was from Nantes that the brother
of his last wife is said to have ridden in hot haste to rescue his
wretched sister and make an end of the odious old tyrant.</p>

<p>Taking a row-boat by the high, old bridge which, just on the outskirts
of Nantes, spans the river Erdre, you find yourself at first on
a broad sheet of water, with quaint, whitewashed stone-houses and
huts, their roofs covered with red brick tiles, and occasionally more
handsome mansions with lawns and gardens extending to the river-bank.
Here you may perhaps observe a row of curious flat-boats
with roofs, but open on all sides, lining both banks of the stream. In
these are a number of hard-featured, dark-skinned women of all ages,
washing clothes. They lean over the boat-sides, and scrub the shirts
and handkerchiefs in the water, then withdraw them, lay them smoothly
on some flat boards, like a table, and taking a flat hammer pound upon
them.</p>

<p>Presently you get past these, if you row vigorously, and come to
pretty bends in the river, and find yourself beyond the thickly-settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
part, amidst pleasant rural fields, with some wealthy merchant&rsquo;s mansion
raising its towers above the green trees.</p>

<p>After a while you approach a bright little village, all of whose
houses form a single street just along the banks of the river. Here
you disembark and pass along the village street, across a rickety bridge
which spans a little inlet from the stream, and so out into the country,
and through paths in the woods thickly grown with brush and wildflowers.</p>

<p>Presently, soon after you have got out of sight of the village, you
ascend a gentle hill, and suddenly come upon an old, old house, with
its wooden ribs appearing, crossing each other, through the stone
walls, and a roof that looks as if about to fall in upon the people who
inhabit it.</p>

<p>Just beyond this, deeply imbedded in shrubs, brush, thickly-grown
ivies and other vines, and moss, is all that is left of Blue-beard&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>The walls are still there, dividing the apartments. You can imagine
the rooms and the tower which arose above the tall trees that
here cluster on the river bank. And you may fancy, as you stand
among the beautiful ruins, that you are on the very spot where the
room used to be which Blue-beard forbade his last wife to enter.</p>

<p>Here is the portal, now crumbled and almost covered with moss and
ivy, where the old tyrant came in and out; there the wall where the last
of his poor victims sat, looking out and straining her eyes to see her
brother coming; beyond, the spot where Blue-beard was struck down,
and received his deserts. It seems too beautiful a place for so remorseless
an ogre; and as one looks out upon the lovely scenes where the
tearful spouses mourned their lot, one cannot help thinking how happy
they might have been in such a charming retreat, had they enjoyed it
with loving husbands and happy homes.</p>

<p><span class="dco02"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>NLY three days more remain to us in France,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis, after spending two days in Nantes. &ldquo;We will now
return to Paris by rail, stopping a few hours in Orleans,
and from Paris will go directly to Havre, whence we will
take the steamer for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Wyllys Wynn, &ldquo;that, after what we have
seen, I shall like no reading so well as history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been my aim,&rdquo; said Master Lewis, &ldquo;to take you to those
places where the principal great events of the histories of England
and France have occurred. I stopped at Carlisle to give you a lesson
in the early history of Britain,&mdash;the periods of the Druids and the
Romans. I took you to Glastonbury to give you a view of the history
of the early English Church. I went with you to Aix-la-Chapelle that
you might receive an impression of the dominion of Charlemagne.
Normandy is the common ground of old English and French history.
I was glad to select it for you as the direct object of our visit, although
it has formed a small part of our journey. I, like Tommy, have had
a secret which I have kept for the Club; it has been to interest you
in the places and events which would lead you, on your return, to
become more careful readers of the best books. I hope the journey
will leave an historic outline in your minds that future reading will
fill. Character is as much determined by the books one reads as by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
the company one keeps. Show me a boy&rsquo;s selection of books, and I
will tell you what he is and what he is likely to become.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Lewis,&rdquo; said Wyllys, &ldquo;says he has aimed to take us to
such historic places as would give us, at the end of the journey, a connected
picture of English and of French history. Let us try to associate
the places we have seen with historic events. As I think of our
Scottish and English journey, I connect,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carlisle with the Druids and Romans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glastonbury with Early Christianity and the Boy Kings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Normandy with William the Conqueror and his sons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nottingham with Robin Hood and the Norman and Plantagenet
Kings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boscobel with King Charles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edinburgh with Mary, the Edwards, and the Douglases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kenilworth with Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oxford with Canute and Alfred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;London with the Tudors, the Commonwealth, the Georges, and
Victoria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In our journey on the continent,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;I associate,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brussels with Waterloo and Napoleon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aix-la-Chapelle with Charlemagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghent and Bruges with the Dukes of Flanders and Burgundy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calais with Mary Tudor and Edward III. of England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rouen with Charles VII. and Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paris with Charles IX., the Bourbons, and Napoleon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nantes with the Huguenots and the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have also had views of the homes and haunts of great
authors,&rdquo; said Ernest. &ldquo;I have made a scrap-book of leaves and
flowers from the homes and graves of men of letters, and it includes
souvenirs of nearly all the most eminent names in English literature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Havre is really a port of Paris, and is one of the most thriving
maritime towns of France. Like most port towns it is more businesslike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
than picturesque. The Class made but two visits here, outside of
the hotel. One of these was to the birthplace of Bernardin de St.
Pierre in Rue de la Cordesis, and the other to the cliffs on which the
great French light-houses are erected at a height of three hundred feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Corneille, the great Corneille, as the popular dramatist
came to be called, read his masterpiece, <i>Polyeucte</i>, to a party of fashionable
literary people in Paris, it was coolly received on account of the
fine Christian sentiments it contained. The criticism was that the
religion of the stage should be that, not of God, but of the gods.
Even a bishop present took this view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bernardin de St. Pierre was as sharply criticised when he first
read in public his beautiful romance of &lsquo;Paul and Virginia.&rsquo; It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
at a party given by Madame Necker. &lsquo;At first,&rsquo; says a writer, &lsquo;every
one listened in silence; then the company began to whisper, then to
yawn. Monsieur de Buffon ordered his carriage, and slipped out of
the nearest door. The ladies who listened were ridiculed when tears
at last gathered in their eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">RACINE READING TO LOUIS XIV.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Polyeucte</i> still lives in French literature, and the wits who condemned
it are forgotten; &lsquo;Paul and Virginia&rsquo; charmed France; fifty
imitations of it were published in a single year, and it was rapidly
translated into all European tongues. It remains a classic, but the
critics in Madame Necker&rsquo;s parlors are recollected only for their
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must read the works of these French authors on our return,&rdquo;
said Wyllys, &ldquo;or at least the best selections from them. I shall wish
to read &lsquo;Pascal&rsquo;s Provincial Letters&rsquo; and the Letters of Madame de
S&eacute;vign&eacute;, after what you have said of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should also read some of the best selections from the works
of Boileau, Moli&egrave;re, and Racine. I have only time to allude to them
briefly here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
&ldquo;These authors were friends. They all lived in the time of the
Grand Monarch, as Louis XIV. was called. La Fontaine, some
of whose fables you have read, belongs to the same period, which is
the greatest in French literature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louis XIV. appreciated nearly all the great writers of the time;
he seems to have felt that great authors, like great palaces, would add
lustre to his reign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that we might better change our society on our return
into a reading-club,&rdquo; said Tommy Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me your proposal is a very good one,&rdquo; said Master
Lewis. &ldquo;We may be able to travel again. If we should visit Germany
or the Latin lands together another year, a reading-club would
be an excellent preparation for the journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much better than a Secret Society,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Suppose
you give the Class the secret you devised for our first meetings,
Tommy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Tommy, soberly, &ldquo;that, like most of my other plans,
was just <em>nothing, after all</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away from busy Havre the next morning, under the French and
American flags, moved a little ocean world; and on the decks, looking
back to the fading shores of old Normandy, and cherishing delightful
memories of their zigzag journeys in historic lands, were the teacher
and the lads whose winding ways we have followed.</p>

<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been repaired. Hyphenation and use of accents
has been made consistent.</p>

<p>Use of quote marks is inconsistent, particularly around poetry and for
continuing quotations, but is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>The illustration caption, 'THE BLACK DOUGLAS SURPRISING AN ENEMY' on page
<a href="#blackdouglas">100</a> was omitted from the List of Illustrations. It has been added in this
e-text.</p>

<p>The uncaptioned sketch of thread from the Bayeux Tapestry, on page <a href="#thread">164</a>,
is not included in the List of Illustrations. This may have been
deliberate, as it is supposed to be a sketch by one of the class,
and so has not been added by the transcriber.</p>

<p>The List of Illustrations had the image on page <a href="#whitehall">187</a> as 'OLD HAMPTON COURT',
while the caption under the illustration read 'WHITEHALL'. The Transcriber
has confirmed that the illustration is a picture of the old Whitehall Palace
(see painting <i>The Old Palace of Whitehall</i>, by Hendrik Danckerts for
comparison), and has amended the text in the List of Illustrations to match
the caption in the text.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_166">166</a> includes the word 'flustrated'. This may be a typographic error
for 'frustrated', or it may be deliberate on the part of the author, perhaps
a combination of 'flustered' and 'frustrated'. As there is no way to be sure
which is the case, it is preserved as printed.</p>

<p>The following amendments have been made&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Page <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a>&mdash;Falise amended to Falaise&mdash;"Statue of William the Conqueror
at Falaise"</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_vii">vii</a>&mdash;the word 'At' deleted and the amended to The,
to match the caption in the main text&mdash;"The Death-bed of Francis II."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_57">57</a>&mdash;Ingraciate amended to Ingratiate&mdash;"... one on <i>Ingratiate</i>
(in grey she ate); ..."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_173">173</a>&mdash;Wyatt amended to Wyat&mdash;"... The Tower.&mdash;Sir Henry Wyat and His
Cat.&mdash;Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s Wax Works...."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_220">220</a>&mdash;der amended to de&mdash;"All the Foresters of Flanders,&mdash;mighty Baldwin
Bras de Fer, ..."</p>
</div>

<p>The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow the title
page. Other illustrations have been moved where necessary so that
they are not in the middle of a paragraph.</p>

<p>Omitted page numbers were unnumbered illustration or blank pages in the original.</p>
